### **Project Management: Core Concepts & Methodologies - Notes**

**I. Defining Key Terms**

- **Project:** A **temporary effort that creates value**.
  - Examples: Developing a new app, building a skyscraper, planning an event.
  - Characteristics: Has a sequence of activities, specific time, specific budget, meets customer needs.
- **Management (Henri Fayol's Definition):** Functions managers perform.
  - Original functions: Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, Controlling.
  - Modern adaptation: Planning, Organizing, **Leadership** (combines commanding and coordinating), Controlling.
- **Project Management:** The use of specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to deliver something of value to people.
  - PMI defines it as using specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to deliver value.

**II. Characteristics of Projects**

Projects are distinct from ongoing operations and possess unique characteristics:

- **Temporary:** Have a beginning and an end date (start and finish).
  - End conditions: Objectives met, money runs out, no longer a need, or project is cancelled/terminated.
  - Without an end date, it's considered **operations** (ongoing and permanent).
  - Example: Building an assembly line is a project; manufacturing automobiles on it is operations.
- **Unique:** Fill a specific objective or create a new product/service.
  - Example: Creating a project management course.
- **Create Value:** Deliver value for an individual or organization.
  - Can improve existing products or services.
  - Outcome can be tangible (e.g., rocket booster) or intangible (e.g., software update, document).
  - Example: Hardware upgrade increases employee efficiency, reduces costs, or increases data security, thus creating value.
- **Initiate Change:** Bring on a change in the status quo for the company or customer.
  - Example: Hardware upgrade replacing obsolete systems.
- **Have a Deliverable:** Projects create something and have a deliverable.

**III. Functions of Management (Expanded)**

- **Planning:** Setting direction, communicating goals, defining methods, determining steps, knowing available resources and tools.
- **Organizing:** Bringing together resources (people, funding, equipment) to support end goals.
- **Leading/Leadership:** Focusing on the human aspect; hiring, managing, training, coaching, reviewing performance, setting an example.
- **Controlling:** Verifying everything works according to plan, schedule, and budget.

**IV. The Project Manager (PM) Role and Responsibilities**

Project Managers are central to project success.

- **What they do:**
  - Bring everything together; connect people to resources, set direction to accomplish goals.
  - Connect people to the process.
  - Have ultimate responsibility for project success.
  - Apply project management tools, lead and manage people to deliver completed projects and create value.
  - Use management skills to solve business problems or act on opportunities.
  - Define what needs to be done, detail tasks, develop plans, manage resources (people, facilities, supplies).
  - Develop metrics to measure implementation.
  - Consistently communicate project status to stakeholders.
  - Turn over the project to the customer/client/user upon completion.
  - Reflect and document lessons learned for future projects.
- **Qualities of a Project Manager:** Organized, passionate, goal-oriented, understand commonalities in projects and their strategic role.
  - Comfortable in ever-changing environments, drive change, lead others.
  - Master project management tools and techniques.
  - Ability to work with cross-functional teams.
  - Culturally aware and servant leaders.
  - A good project manager collaborates with the team to set ground rules for communication and scope changes.
  - A good project manager is a **problem solver**.
- **Managing Client Expectations:** A core responsibility, especially for technical project managers. This involves managing expectations around four key areas (often referred to as the "triple constraint" plus quality):
  1.  **Scope:** All requirements for the project (e.g., list of requirements for a house).
  2.  **Budget:** How much money is allocated for the project.
  3.  **Schedule:** How long it takes to complete the project.
  4.  **Quality:** Ensuring the deliverables are robust and usable (e.g., ensuring few bugs in software).
- **PM as "Overhead":** Some may perceive PMs as "overhead" because they ensure work gets done rather than completing configurations or setting things up themselves.

**V. Project Management Process Groups (5)**

These define **what a project manager does** and provide a chronological process.

1.  **Initiating the Project:**
    - Provide the scope for the project.
    - Ensure customer and stakeholder expectations are met.
    - Understand the business environment, company's strategic direction, strengths, weaknesses.
    - Deep understanding of company assets (tools, templates, lab/office space).
    - Develop the **business case** for the project.
    - Develop and share documents (e.g., **Project Charter**) that show the project's value, quantifying and communicating it to stakeholders.
    - First step: initial documentation and identifying project stakeholders.
2.  **Planning the Project:**
    - A well-defined process to project planning.
    - Define project activities, including duration, cost, and resources needed.
    - Build a project schedule.
    - Identify potential risks and plan to address/mitigate them before the project begins.
    - Detailed schedule and cost estimate, quality plans, corrective action activities.
    - Develop communication strategy to engage stakeholders and the team.
    - Identify how to purchase/acquire supplies and people.
    - **Crucial for success:** A good plan is vital, while a bad plan leads to an unsuccessful project.
3.  **Executing the Project:**
    - Bring together the project team.
    - Collaborate with the team to set ground rules and address scope changes.
    - Launch the project: procure necessary resources, determine milestones.
    - Much of the actual work of the project is done here.
    - PM's time is spent leading and developing the team.
4.  **Monitoring and Controlling the Project:**
    - Ensure the project is on track to meet milestones.
    - Ensure project performance and quality standards are met.
    - Collect performance data and compare to predetermined metrics.
    - Implement risk mitigation strategies (e.g., assigning more resources).
    - Communicate data and project status to stakeholders.
    - Track, review, regulate progress and performance.
    - Measure actual progress to predicted milestones and use corrective actions if behind schedule, over budget, or experiencing quality issues.
5.  **Closing the Project:**
    - Gain customer/client approval for meeting requirements.
    - Turn the project over to the client.
    - Final project documentation and writing a project report.
    - Reflect and share lessons learned to guide future projects.

**VI. Project Management Knowledge Areas (10)**

These define **what a project manager needs to know**.

1.  **Integration Management:**
    - Ensures proper coordination of various project elements.
    - **Most important** as it brings everything together for informed decision-making.
    - Occurs continuously across the entire project life cycle.
2.  **Scope Management:**
    - Ensures the project includes **all and only** the required work.
    - Define outputs and benefits; identify all project requirements.
    - Crucial for a clear understanding of project assumptions and constraints.
3.  **Schedule Management:**
    - Ensures project completion on time.
    - Helps the project run smoothly and efficiently; stakeholders need to know milestone dates.
4.  **Cost Management:**
    - Ensures project completion within the approved budget.
    - Important for proving a project's value.
5.  **Quality Management:**
    - Ensures the project satisfies the needs for which it was undertaken.
    - PMs measure quality continually and take corrective actions.
    - Requires a solid, data-driven plan for quality planning, control, and assurance.
6.  **Resource Management:**
    - Ensures effective use of people involved (often human resources).
    - One of the most challenging areas due to focus on people and performance.
    - Includes hiring, allocating people, and the PM serving as a leader.
7.  **Communications Management:**
    - Ensures project knowledge is generated, collected, shared, and archived timely and securely.
    - Poor communication is a major reason for project failure.
    - Ensures right messages reach right people at right time, in correct format/channel.
8.  **Risk Management:**
    - Identifies, analyses, and responds to project risks.
    - PM asks: What can go wrong? How to prevent it? What to do if it goes wrong?.
    - Risks can be to schedule (e.g., material shortages) or resources (e.g., losing a team member).
    - Provides tools to identify, categorize, quantify risks, and develop a response plan.
9.  **Procurement Management:**
    - Acquires goods and services from outside the organization.
    - Involves creating/maintaining vendor relationships, outsourcing for specific needs.
    - PM needs to understand the procurement process.
10. **Stakeholder Management:**
    - Identifies and develops relationships with people/organizations impacted by the project.
    - **Stakeholder:** Anyone with influence or power over the project, team, or outcome.
    - Examples: Customer, team members, investors, suppliers, government agencies.
    - PMs need a plan to keep stakeholders informed at each project lifecycle step.

**VII. Project Management Methodologies**

**A. Waterfall Project Management (Traditional/Predictive)**

- **Focus:** Developing a comprehensive plan and strictly following it.
- **When to use:** Requirements are **well known** and stable.
  - Examples: Building a house, building a bridge, manufacturing a plane.
  - Changes are expensive, especially with physical/tangible items.
- **Flow (sequential):** Called "waterfall" because it flows from one step to the next.
  1.  Gather all requirements at the beginning.
  2.  Create the design.
  3.  Develop or build the solution.
  4.  Test and validate.
  5.  Deploy.
- **Outcome:** Usually **one big outcome** or "big bang" at the end, after all phases are complete.
- **Planning Tools:** Generally uses a **traditional work breakdown structure (WBS)**.
  - Breaks down deliverables into tasks (starting with verbs) to the lowest level for estimation of time, cost, and resources.
  - Identifies dependencies and orders tasks to determine the critical path.
- **Measurement:** Measures against an original plan or **baseline** to track if ahead/behind schedule or within/over budget.

**B. Agile Project Management**

- **Focus:** Collaborative approach with the customer, adapting to evolving requirements.
- **When to use:** Requirements are **not as well known** or may change.
  - Originally developed for software development.
  - Good for innovative projects.
- **Collaboration:** Close work with the customer throughout the project to gather additional requirements.
- **Sprints:** Work is done in **time-boxes** called sprints.
  - A sprint is a set amount of time (e.g., 2 weeks, typically 1-4 weeks, consistent throughout the project) to accomplish specific work.
  - Part of the project is delivered **incrementally** after each sprint.
- **Backlog:** Uses a **product/project backlog** to gather and prioritize requirements.
  - Prioritizes items (must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, won't-haves).
  - Work for sprints is pulled from the highest priority items in the backlog.
- **Feedback Loop:** Increments are showcased to the customer for feedback; new requirements may be added to the backlog and reprioritized.
- **Resources:** Dedicated resources tend to work best.
- **Scrum:** A common **Agile approach** for executing projects, with specific roles.

**C. Hybrid Project Management**

- **Definition:** A combined approach, customising elements of both Waterfall and Agile.
- **Customisation:** Tailored to the organization's structure, culture, project needs, and team.
- **Application:** Can switch between methodologies for different phases or run them concurrently (e.g., Waterfall for hardware, Agile for software).
  - Example: Building a plane might use Waterfall for the physical aircraft (expensive changes) and Agile for software components (less expensive changes).

**VIII. Project Management Institute (PMI)**

- **Role:** Non-profit global professional organization that provides resources and training for project management.
  - Catalyst for advancing the profession.
  - Hosts local and virtual events for professional development.
- **Certification:** Offers the **Project Management Professional (PMP)** certification.
  - Well-known and recognized worldwide as a standard.
  - Not necessary but highly regarded.
- **PMBOK:** Maintains the **Project Management Body of Knowledge**, a foundational resource for effective project management.
  - Contains specific knowledge areas essential for certified PMs.

**IX. Processes (49)**

- There are 49 specific processes that define the **way** project managers accomplish tasks, or the tools and techniques they use.
- Each process fits into a specific process group and coordinates with a specific knowledge area.
- These processes are not individually detailed in the provided transcripts but are noted as being important and will be covered in future lessons/courses.

### **Project Management: Project Charter, Scope Management & Work Breakdown Structure - Crisp Notes**

**I. The Project Charter**

- **Definition:** A document, usually prepared by the project manager or project sponsor, that provides a high-level overview of the entire project.
- **Purpose:**
  - **Justifies the project** and explains **why it's needed**.
  - Tells the **story of the project** and paints a picture of why it's needed to **create value** for the organization.
  - Gives the **project manager the authority to get started** with the project.
  - Ensures **everyone is on the same page** regarding the project.
- **Placement in Process Groups and Knowledge Areas:**
  - It is the **first step in project work**.
  - It is the **first process in the Initiating phase** (or "initiating the project phase").
  - It belongs to the **Project Integration Management knowledge area**, which encompasses the entire project and is ongoing.
- **Key Areas Addressed (Five):**
  1.  **Justification:** Clearly states why the project is needed and how it creates value for the organization.
  2.  **Project Objectives and/or Deliverables:** What will be delivered, tied directly to company objectives.
  3.  **Measurable Goals (Requirements and Constraints):** What the project commits to deliver, and importantly, **what the project will _not_ accomplish** (exclusions).
  4.  **Stakeholders and Team Members:** Identifies who will be involved and helpful for success.
  5.  **High-level Budget/Financial Investment/ROI and Project Milestones/Overall Timeline:** Financial information (if known) and key dates.
- **Important Contents (Specific Details):**
  - Project Title.
  - Purpose or Description.
  - High-level Objectives, Requirements, and Deliverables.
  - Potential Risks.
  - Key Milestones.
  - Resources Needed for success.
  - Potential Stakeholders.
  - **Approval Requirements:** Defines what success looks like and **who signs off upon completion** of the project.
  - People: Project Manager, resources, project team members, and the project sponsor.

**II. Project Scope Management**

- **PMI Definition:** The work required to output a project's deliverable, including processes to manage scope changes and ensure the project remains on time and within budget. Changes should occur only through **formal change control procedures**.
- **Importance:**
  - **Defines what the project team will be delivering**.
  - Defines the **boundaries of the project** – **what you will do and, more importantly, what you _won't_ do**.
  - Essential for the project manager to **manage stakeholder and customer expectations**.
  - A well-defined project scope is a **tool for the project manager to push back on out-of-scope requests** or **justify additional resources** if the scope broadens or changes.
  - Lists the work that needs to be done to deliver the product or service to meet user requirements.
- **Project Scope Statement:**
  - A **documented description of the project's scope**, its specific deliverables, project boundaries, team responsibilities, cost estimates, and schedule estimates.
  - Its purpose is to **ensure all stakeholders understand the deliverables and major milestones**.
- **Scope Management Plan:**
  - Will define **how the project manager will handle requests for changes that are outside the scope**.
  - Details how the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be developed and the process for approving project deliverables.
- **Scope Creep:**
  - Requests from stakeholders for **changes that are outside the agreed-upon scope**.
  - Project managers must **avoid scope creep**. If changes are necessary, proper change control procedures should be followed.
- **The Project Management Constraint Triangle (or Iron Triangle):**
  - Shows that **scope, cost, and time are all interconnected**.
  - When you change one parameter, there are **implications for the other parameters**.
  - If changes are introduced, it can **throw the entire triangle out of balance**.
  - It is the **project manager's job to balance these constraints**.
  - **Quality** is also a critical factor and **should not be compromised** as a result of changing scope, schedule, or adding cost.
  - Example: If time is reduced, options include bringing in more resources, which **increases the overall cost**.
- **Six Processes of Project Scope Management:** These fall under the Project Management Knowledge Areas and Process Groups.
  - **Under Planning Process Group (4 processes):**
    1.  **Plan Scope Management:** Create the scope plan document containing the project scope statement, requirements, deliverables, and the process for handling change requests.
    2.  **Collect Requirements:** Determine client and stakeholder requirements (deliverables, budget, training needs, non-functional requirements) by working closely with all stakeholders.
    3.  **Define Scope:** Translate customer requirements into a detailed description of deliverables, project exclusions, and set project boundaries.
    4.  **Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Break down all project work into smaller **work packages**.
  - **Under Monitoring & Controlling Process Group (2 processes):** 5. **Validate Scope:** Deliverables and scope need to be **approved by the appropriate stakeholder or client** (e.g., sponsor or customer). This is an important step in initiating the project. 6. **Control Scope:** Project managers ensure the project stays within scope and **avoid scope creep**. If scope changes are needed, formal change control procedures must be followed.

**III. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

- **Definition:** A graphical form that shows your entire project by breaking down project elements into smaller units called **work packages**.
- **Purpose/Reasons for Breakdown:**
  - Identifies **every element of the project work**.
  - Each work package focuses on a **specific deliverable**.
  - Ensures **every deliverable is detailed and nothing is missed**.
- **Structure:**
  - **Level one is the project deliverable**.
  - **Level two breaks down each component into a smaller deliverable or process**.
  - Can be broken down into smaller chunks to assign responsibility or action to team members.
  - Break down to the **lowest level** for accurate estimation of time, cost, and resources.
- **Uses:**
  - **Project cost budgeting:** Each component of the WBS should be estimated for project costing.
  - **Project timing:** A good tool to build a project sequence, schedule, and its milestones.
- **WBS Dictionary:**
  - Adds **context to the WBS**.
  - Provides a **description of work packages**, detailing assumptions and explaining interdependencies.
  - Gives the project manager another tool to **prevent scope creep** and provide clear communications to stakeholders.

**IV. Project Management Software**

- Commercially available software programs provide templates for managing project scope, schedule, and budgeting applications.
- Companies must determine which program or template is best for their specific project.

Here are crisp notes from the provided transcripts, designed to cover every possible important point for an MCQ-based test focusing on Stakeholder Management and Communication:

### **Project Management: Stakeholder Management & Communication - Crisp Notes**

**I. Defining Stakeholders**

- **Definition:** Anyone who can **impact your project** or **be impacted by your project**.
- **Importance of Communication:** Vital for project success.
- **Varying Information Needs:** Some stakeholders need to know about the project throughout its lifecycle, while others only need information at specific key points.
- **Goal of Stakeholder Management:** To **manage their expectations** throughout the entire project so that project deliverables can be achieved on time, on budget, and within scope.

**II. Stakeholder Management Process Groups & Processes**

- Stakeholder management has **four processes** across **four different process groups**.
- The four processes are:
  1.  **Identify Stakeholders**
  2.  **Plan Stakeholder Management**
  3.  **Manage Stakeholder Engagement**
  4.  **Monitor Stakeholder Engagement**

**III. Types of Stakeholders**

1.  **Internal Stakeholders:** Employees of your company.
    - Have an interest in the success of your project.
    - Examples: Project sponsor, internal project team members, board members of the corporation.
2.  **External Stakeholders:** People who don't work for your company but have an interest in the project.
    - Examples: Investors, suppliers, community members where your project is taking place.
3.  **Clients:**
    - Include the customer who purchases the output of your project or service.
    - Can also mean the end-user.
4.  **Governmental or Regulatory Stakeholders:**
    - The government is a stakeholder in many projects, which must conform to local laws and regulations.
    - Examples: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for environmental concerns, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pharmaceutical development projects.

**IV. Stakeholder Analysis**

- **Why it's needed:** To **identify stakeholders early** and then **determine their interests and influence** on your project.
- **How to conduct analysis:** Categorizing and classifying stakeholders by:
  1.  Their **interest** in your project.
  2.  Their **influence** on your project or within the organization.
  3.  Their **level of involvement** in your project (how involved they want to be or are anticipated to be).
- **Main Goal:** To **manage their expectations** in the project.
- **Method:** Gather your team for a brainstorming session to identify all potential stakeholders. Create an inclusive list to plan engagement and communication throughout the project.
- **Techniques/Models:** The two popular models discussed are the Salience Model and the Power Interest Grid.

**V. Salience Model**

- **Evaluation Criteria:** Stakeholders are assigned to one of seven categories based on their levels of **Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency** with your project.
  - **Power:** Having a position of authority.
  - **Legitimacy:** Belonging within the project, having a vested interest.
  - **Urgency:** Having a critical need for the project to happen (or not happen), or being time-driven.
- **Seven Categories (based on overlaps of Power, Legitimacy, Urgency):**
  1.  **Discretionary:** Have **legitimacy** but no power or urgency.
      - Example: A local charity benefiting from a company volunteer day – has legitimacy and interest, but no power.
  2.  **Dependent:** Overlapping **urgency and legitimacy**, but no power.
      - Example: Restaurant owners impacted by a road closure from a construction project – have legitimacy and urgency, but no power. Need to be monitored as they might combine efforts to hamper progress.
  3.  **Demanding:** High **urgency**, but low power and legitimacy.
      - Example: A patron picketing outside a project site due to affected restaurant.
  4.  **Dangerous:** Possess **power and urgency**, but no legitimate connection to the project.
      - Example: Someone attempting to sabotage the project or destroy equipment.
  5.  **Dormant:** Have **power**, but no legitimacy or urgency.
      - Example: An executive not engaged in your project, but you still need to be aware of their opinions due to their power.
  6.  **Dominant:** Have **power and legitimacy**, but no urgency.
  7.  **Definitive:** Possess **power, legitimacy, and urgency**.
      - **Very important stakeholders**.
      - Examples: Project sponsor or project customer.
      - Require the **most engagement and collaboration**.
- **Non-stakeholders:** People who don't fit into any categories and for whom no plan is needed.

**VI. Power Interest Grid**

- **Most Common Tool** for stakeholder analysis.
- **Matrix Classification:** Stakeholders are classified by their level of **power** (Y-axis) and **interest** (X-axis) in the project outcomes.
- **Four Quadrants:**
  1.  **Players (High Interest, High Power) - Upper Right Quadrant:**
      - Examples: Project sponsor, customer, client.
      - **Strategy:** Keep them **engaged** in the project; seek their **collaboration**.
  2.  **Subjects (High Interest, Low Power) - Lower Right Quadrant:**
      - Example: A key administrative support person who is highly engaged and influential in parts of your project.
      - **Strategy:** **Consult them** for their insights and ideas; **keep them informed**.
  3.  **Context Setters (High Power, Low Interest) - Upper Left Quadrant:**
      - Have a lot of influence but only want **high-level facts** and don't dwell on details.
      - Example: Director of Engineering (if needing engineering support).
      - **Strategy:** Ensure they **remain satisfied** with the project's progress.
  4.  **Crowd (Low Power, Low Interest) - Lower Left Quadrant:**
      - Require communication about progress, but not at the same level as others.
      - **Strategy:** Provide information (e.g., via website or social media post), but **do not ask for feedback in return**.

**VII. Relationship with Communications Management**

- **Stakeholder management and communications management go hand in hand**.
- A solid plan for managing stakeholder expectations depends on the **level of communication and engagement** the project manager offers throughout the project.
- Project managers now have the tools to analyze stakeholder needs and develop a comprehensive communication strategy.

Here are comprehensive notes from the provided transcript, structured for an MCQ-based exam, ensuring all important information is included and appropriately cited:

## Project Team and Resource Management: Key Concepts

### 1. Understanding Resources in Project Management

- **Broad Definition of Resources:** Includes equipment, inventory, money (cash, capital), and people needed to accomplish project goals.
- **Project Manager's Key Questions about Resources:** What resources are needed, when are they needed, how can they be acquired, and how to ensure their efficient and effective use.
- **People as the Most Important Resource:** Project managers often equate resource management with human resource management because project completion is impossible without people.
- **PMBOK Definition of Project Resource Management:** Involves processes to **identify, acquire, and manage** the resources necessary for successful project completion. It ensures the right resources are available to the project manager and team at the right time and place.
- **Categorisation of Resources:**
  - **Capital:** Equipment, land, buildings, funding, dedicated office space.
  - **Technology:** Software, data protection needs.
  - **People (Team Members):** Acquiring the right people, managing and leading them, evaluating performance, developing incentives, providing training.

### 2. Project Resource Management as a Knowledge Area

- Project Resource Management is a **knowledge area** within project management.
- It contains **six different processes** spread across the Planning, Executing, Monitoring, and Controlling process groups.

#### A. Planning Group Processes:

1.  **Plan Resource Management:**

    - Project managers determine how to **estimate, acquire, and use physical resources**.
    - Also defines how to **lead the project team**.
    - Results in a **formal Resource Management Plan**. This plan outlines necessary components for effective resource planning.
    - Includes defining project needs, assigning resources effectively, efficiently, and appropriately.
    - Tools: Developing a **project organisation chart** for streamlined task assignment, and using a **Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)** and **RACI Chart** (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed).

2.  **Estimate Activity Resources:**
    - Project managers use the **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** and work packages to determine needed resources throughout the project.
    - Results in a **Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS)** or Resource Lists, which clearly defines resources and their timing.

#### B. Executing Process Group Processes:

1.  **Acquire Resources:**

    - Project managers **recruit team members**.
    - **Buys or rents equipment**, gets materials and supplies to meet project outcomes.

2.  **Develop Team:**
    - Involves management and leadership skills.
    - Project managers undertake activities to **improve individual and team performance**.
    - Includes professional development, training, building trust, creating a positive work environment, building team culture, managing conflicts, and rewarding good team performance.

#### C. Monitoring and Controlling Process Group Processes:

1.  **Manage Team:**

    - Project managers **track and measure team performance**.
    - **Provides feedback** and manages inevitable changes to team members.
    - Optimises team performance and influences team behaviour.

2.  **Control Resources:**
    - Occurs throughout the project.
    - Primarily focuses on **physical resources**.
    - Project managers ensure physical resources are **working as planned** in terms of timing and efficiency to meet project goals.
    - **Distinction:** Project managers _manage and lead people_, but _control physical resources_.

### 3. Resources in a Matrix Organisation

- **Prevalence:** Common in larger companies or those with a global footprint.
- **Definition:** A management structure where employees **report to two or more bosses**.
- **Two Chains of Command:** One along functional lines and the other along project lines. For example, a marketing resource reports to both the project manager and the director of marketing.
- **Contrast with Traditional Structure:** Traditional management has a single chain of command where each employee reports to one manager.
- **Pros (Benefits):**
  - Increases organisational **productivity through flexibility**.
  - More **efficient use of resources** as they can be shared and re-allocated between projects.
  - Access to **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)**, eliminating the need for extensive training or external hiring.
- **Cons (Challenges):**
  - **Complexity** in management.
  - Team members may find it challenging to report to two managers with **competing interests**.
  - **Increased competition for the best resources** among different projects, leading to potential conflict.
- **Types of Matrix Organisations (Balance of Power for Project Manager):**
  - **Weak Matrix:** Project manager has the **least amount of power**, acting more as a project coordinator. The functional manager retains most managerial power.
  - **Balanced Functional Matrix:** Power is **shared equally**. Authority over project-related tasks and allocated resources only. This structure can be difficult for employees due to shared authority.
  - **Strong Project Matrix:** Project manager has the **greatest amount of power**, with a say in resource allocation for the entire project and higher power than the functional manager.
- **Negotiation Skills:** Essential for project managers in matrix organisations to compete for internal resources, especially when scarce or on compressed schedules.

### 4. Project Team and Leadership Foundations

- **Importance of the Team:** Having the right people is crucial for project success.
- **Project Manager's Role:** Responsibility and opportunity to build the team, enhance performance, cultivate a positive environment, and manage conflicts.
- **Setting the Tone:** The team leader has the power to set the tone for the team.

### 5. Types of Power (French and Raven, 1950s)

- Psychologists John French and Bertram Raven identified five types of power based on how people achieve results from others.
- **Five Bases of Power:**
  1.  **Legitimate Power:** Derived from a **position or formal relationships** within an organisation (e.g., CEO, Vice President over an intern).
  2.  **Reward Power:** The ability to **give benefits** to someone for doing what is desired (e.g., a return favour, a thank you, or a future obligation).
  3.  **Expert Power:** Based on an individual's **level of expertise, skill, or competence** (e.g., reputation for website design, customer relations, sought-after opinion).
  4.  **Referent Power:** Relates to a person's **likability** and the ability to build relationships (often expert networkers).
  5.  **Coercive Power:** The ability to **punish or force compliance** (e.g., reprimanding an employee, forcing overtime). This power is generally discouraged as it leads to unhappy team members.

### 6. Team Development (Tuckman's Model)

- **Growth Cycles:** Teams experience growth cycles in communication and collaboration.
- **Tuckman's Original Stages (1960s):**
  1.  **Forming:** Initial stage where team members meet and begin to understand the project.
  2.  **Storming:** Characterised by conflict, disagreements, and challenges to leadership.
  3.  **Norming:** Team members begin to resolve differences, develop cohesion, and establish norms for working together.
  4.  **Performing:** The team operates effectively, efficiently, and collaboratively to achieve goals.
- **Added Fifth Stage:** 5. **Adjourning:** The stage where the team or project concludes.
- **Project Manager's Role:** Recognise these stages and lead the team through each to cultivate positive dynamics and build high-performing teams.

### 7. Leadership Types and Styles

- **Leadership Definition:** Not just about managing people, but about **influence**.
- **Variability:** No single "right" style; leadership style may change based on time or situation.
- **Common Leadership Styles:**
  1.  **Servant Leadership:** Puts the **team first**, empowers members, focuses on their needs, and develops them to increase overall performance.
  2.  **Autocratic Leadership:** **Maintains control**, makes decisions based on own judgment, and does not seek input from others.
  3.  **Democratic Leadership:** Seeks **input from the group** and adopts a shared leadership approach.
  4.  **Charismatic Leadership:** **Self-confident**, inspiring, enthusiastic, and personality-driven.
  5.  **Directing Leadership:** Lays out a **clear process and offers specific direction**. Effective with new employees needing on-the-job training.
  6.  **Transactional Leadership:** **Rewards success and punishes failure**, operating on a system of rules and regulations.
  7.  **Transformational Leadership:** **Encourages and inspires team members** to do their best work, motivating them to exceed expectations.
  8.  **Laissez-faire Leadership:** A **hands-off style** where the leader allows the team to set its own goals and make its own decisions.

### 8. Motivation Theories

- **Motivation Concept:** Individuals are motivated by their needs, leading to behaviours aimed at satisfying those needs. Satisfaction can lead to new needs, restarting the cycle.
- **Two Categories of Theories:**
  1.  **Content Theories:** Focus on **"what"** will motivate us, looking at needs and aspirations.
  2.  **Process Theories:** Focus on **"how"** motivation occurs, concerned with the process and how to adjust it.

#### A. Content Theories:

1.  **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:**
    - Needs are arranged in a hierarchy; lower-level needs must be satisfied before moving to higher ones.
    - **Five Levels:**
      - **Physiological:** Food, water.
      - **Safety:** Freedom from war, secure job.
      - **Social:** Relationships, belonging to groups.
      - **Esteem:** Praise, recognition, status.
      - **Self-Actualisation:** Wanting to be the best one can be.
2.  **Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory:**
    - **Motivators:** Encourage harder work when present (e.g., interesting job).
    - **Hygiene Factors:** Cause demotivation when absent (e.g., poor working conditions, poor pay).
3.  **Three Needs Theory:**
    - Individuals have three needs that exist on a scale: **achievement, affiliation** (collaboration, group belonging), and **power**.
    - Managers can use this to set tailored motivational targets.
4.  **McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y:**
    - **Theory X:** Assumes team members are intrinsically **lazy and unmotivated**, avoid work if possible, requiring management to build systems of control and supervision.
    - **Theory Y:** Assumes team members are **ambitious and self-motivated**, and will perform well if provided with the right conditions.
5.  **ERG Theory (Alderfer):**
    - A simplified version of Maslow's hierarchy with three hierarchical needs.
    - **Existence Needs:** Physical well-being (food, water, safety).
    - **Relatedness Needs:** Need to relate to other people.
    - **Growth Needs:** Personal development and desire for meaningful work.
6.  **Mayo's Motivation Theory:**
    - Employee performance is defined by **norms** (positive/negative behaviour encouragement) and **group cohesiveness** (how well the group gets along).
    - Highly cohesive groups with positive norms are most motivated and highest performing.
    - Mayo was the first to recognise that **treating employees well can increase productivity**.

#### B. Process Theories:

1.  **Adam's Equity Theory:**
    - High motivation achieved when employees perceive their **treatment to be fair relative to others**.
    - Perceived unfairness leads to employees adjusting their inputs (e.g., work effort).
2.  **Vroom's Expectancy Theory:**
    - A person chooses behaviour based on the **expected result** of that behaviour.
    - **Three Factors for Motivation:**
      - **Expectancy:** Belief that effort will lead to achievable targets.
      - **Instrumentality:** Belief that a reward will be received if targets are hit.
      - **Valence:** The value and desire for the offered reward.
    - Motivation is higher if these three factors are multiplied together to yield a high result.
3.  **Taylor's Scientific Management (1911):**
    - Believed employees were **only motivated by money**.
    - Assumed workers don't inherently enjoy work and must be **monitored closely** to prevent slacking off.
4.  **Self-Efficacy Theory:**
    - Task-specific motivation; higher self-efficacy (belief in performing a specific task) leads to more motivation.
    - **Four Factors Determining Self-Efficacy:**
      - Experience (similar past jobs).
      - Vicarious Experience (seeing others succeed).
      - Social Persuasion (encouragement from others).
      - Physiological Feedback (ease with the task).
5.  **Reinforcement Theory:**
    - Uses four factors to encourage good behaviour and discourage bad behaviour.
    - **Positive Reinforcement:** Reward for desired behaviour.
    - **Negative Reinforcement:** Reward by removing something negative from the environment.
    - **Punishment:** Threat of a negative consequence to stop undesirable behaviour.
    - **Extinction:** Stopping learned behaviour by withholding the positive reinforcement that led to it.
6.  **Locke's Goal-Setting Theory:**
    - Setting the **right goals** increases both motivation and productivity.
    - **Characteristics of "Right Goals":**
      - **Clarity:** Must be clear.
      - **Challenge:** Must be challenging, but not overly so.
      - **Commitment:** Must be committed to achieving the goal.
      - **Feedback:** Regular feedback boosts commitment.
      - **Task Complexity:** Be aware that a goal should not be too complicated.

### 9. Team Performance Appraisals

- **Challenge in Matrix Organisations:** Project Managers often have responsibility for project deliverables but lack the authority to formally evaluate team members due to multiple reporting lines.
- **Recommendation:** Project Managers should incorporate processes to provide performance feedback within their communication and management plans.

### 10. Emotional Intelligence (Daniel Goleman, 1995)

- **Definition:** Awareness and recognition of one's own emotions, as well as team members' emotions.
- **Purpose:** Understanding emotions can be used for the good of the team.
- **Four Categories of Emotional Intelligence:**
  1.  **Self-Awareness:** Ability to understand one's own emotions, what drives them, and personal strengths/weaknesses.
  2.  **Self-Management:** Managing one's emotions and behaviour.
  3.  **Social Awareness:** Ability to tune into others, recognise, understand, and be empathetic of their emotions.
  4.  **Relationship Management:** Applying emotional understanding in communications and collaborations with others.

### 11. Global Megatrends Affecting Project Management (PMI Report)

- The world and work methods have changed significantly since 2020, impacting project management.
- PMI's "Global Megatrends" report identifies six trends driven by technology, demographics, and globalisation.

#### A. The Six Global Megatrends:

1.  **Acceleration of our Digital World:**
    - **Digital Transformation:** Encompasses technologies like machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), Cloud-based computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
    - **Impact:** Enabled remote project management and efficient global team collaboration during the pandemic.
2.  **The Climate Crisis:**
    - **Urgent Action:** World leaders stress the need for immediate action.
    - **PMI Prediction:** Sustainability practices must be integrated into every project and process to combat climate change.
3.  **Shifting Demographics of the Workforce:**
    - **Talent Gap:** 25 million new project management professionals are needed in the next eight years, but there aren't enough to fill this gap.
    - **The Great Resignation:** A phenomenon (coined during the pandemic) of people resigning or changing jobs in record numbers.
    - **Suggestions:** Incorporate more technology to reduce PM workload and strategically recruit younger workers to rebuild the talent pipeline.
4.  **Disruption in the Supply Chain:**
    - A global issue affecting consumers, companies, and industries; worker supply is a component of economic shifts.
    - **PMI Suggestion:** Build stronger cross-border collaborations to promote knowledge sharing and accelerate global recovery, especially for less connected countries.
5.  **Shifting Employer-Employee Relationship:**
    - **Historic Labor Shortage:** Early 2020s saw a significant shortage, compounded by women and underrepresented minorities leaving the workforce and not returning due to disillusionment with work-life balance.
    - **Employee Expectations:** Workers want more from companies, including positive social impact and recognition/reward for individual contributions.
    - **Organisational Need:** Reset the employer-employee relationship to retain good employees.
6.  **Demand for an Equitable Workforce (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - DEI):**
    - **Goal:** Create a workforce that is more equitable for everyone through systematic integration of DEI.
    - **Key Aspects:**
      - Equal pay for women, ethnic minorities, and others.
      - Inclusion for employees with disabilities.
      - Creating spaces for LGBTQ employees to feel comfortable bringing their full selves to work.
    - **PMI Suggestion:** Embed DEI in every function and process of the value chain. Engage employees in policy creation, incorporate equity in training, form resource groups, and recruit/retain diverse talent by fostering an authentic culture.

### 12. Innovative Teams: Broadening Workforce Diversity and Inclusion

- Organisations face pressure to cultivate diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environments, often struggling with narrow, compliance-driven approaches.
- **Business Case for Workforce Diversity:**
  - Companies with strong diversity commitment achieve **1.3x higher procurement return on investment**.
  - Bias and lack of fair treatment are top factors contributing to **employee turnover**.
  - Growing number of job seekers prioritise organisations valuing inclusion and social responsibility.
  - Increasing societal and investor expectations, including ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria.
- **Key Challenges in Achieving Progress:**
  - **Narrow Focus on Representation:** Primarily addresses demographic diversity in hiring without ensuring equitable access to career advancement, mentorship, and leadership.
  - **Overly Simplistic Approaches:** Treats individuals as broad demographic groups rather than understanding nuanced personal and professional experiences.
  - **Lack of Integration with Business Strategy:** Diversity is often viewed as a compliance initiative, not a fundamental business driver for innovation, market expansion, and brand reputation.
- **Strategic Shifts for Leaders (BCG Recommendations):**
  1.  **Expand Scope of Workforce Inclusion Efforts:**
      - Move beyond traditional demographics to recognise **intersectionality of employee identities** and evolving needs.
      - Address the **full spectrum of employee experiences** (recruitment to leadership opportunities).
      - Develop policies supporting both **functional** (e.g., pay equity) and **emotional** (e.g., feeling valued) aspects of workplace satisfaction.
  2.  **Embed Inclusive Practices Across Business Operations:**
      - Leverage diversity for **innovation**, developing products/services for underserved communities.
      - Expand **supplier diversity programs** for resilient supply chains.
      - Partner with external stakeholders for systemic change.
  3.  **Use Data-Driven Metrics to Measure Impact:**
      - Assess **representation, workplace inclusion, career progression, and long-term retention**.
      - Align diversity goals with broader business objectives (financial performance, customer engagement, market expansion).
      - Enhance transparency by publicly reporting progress and holding leadership accountable.
  4.  **Amplify the Role of Business in Societal Change:**
      - Leadership in promoting inclusion builds **stronger brand loyalty** and attracts top talent.
      - Align business strategy with social impact initiatives (e.g., supporting diverse entrepreneurs).
- **Overall Goal:** Shift from treating inclusion as a compliance requirement to embedding it as a **core driver of business success**, fostering innovation and enhancing employee engagement.

## Project Scheduling and Management Methodologies: Exam Notes

### 1. Project Management Methodologies

Project management offers different lifecycles, primarily categorised into two main methodologies: **Predictive** (or Traditional) and **Agile**.

#### A. Predictive Model (Waterfall)

- **Nature:** Follows a **linear path** for project scheduling.
- **Milestones:** More **defined and sequenced** upfront.
- **Response to Change:** **Does not respond well to changes** to the project or schedule. Risks of schedule or scope changes are actively managed and reduced because they can significantly disrupt the plan.
- **Phases:** Follows the stages of **initiating, planning, executing, controlling and monitoring, and closing**. Each stage has well-defined processes and tools.
- **Planning:** The project manager **plans the entire schedule upfront**. All planning is completed at the beginning.
- **Suitability:** Best used when the **scope is well-defined** or if the project is similar to a previous successful project.
- **Scheduling:** May follow a stage gate process for managing the schedule.

#### B. Agile Project Management

- **Nature:** Uses an **iterative process**.
- **Value Creation:** Prioritises **creating value through quicker releases** and encourages more frequent delivery, focusing on creating value early and often.
- **Response to Change:** **Welcomes changes** to the project and schedule.
- **Team Work:** Teams work more **collaboratively** to plan, execute, verify, and deliver on smaller iterations or segments of the project.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Sprints:** Short cycles of planning followed by immediate execution.
  - **Scrum Master:** The title for the project manager in Agile methodology.
  - **Kanban:** A system often used for project scheduling and monitoring in Agile. It's a "work in progress" system where project parts move across a board from left to right until they are tested, validated, and delivered.
- **Comparision:** Agile is not inherently better than the predictive model for every project or situation; suitability depends on project characteristics.

### 2. Project Schedule Management (Traditional/Predictive Model)

Project Schedule Management is a **knowledge area** within the traditional or predictive model of project management. Its purpose is to define the process for delivering the project to clients on time, including estimating steps, meeting milestones, and determining the quickest way to meet project needs.

This knowledge area contains **six processes** across the Planning and Monitoring & Controlling process groups:

#### A. Planning Group Processes:

1.  **Plan Schedule Management**

    - **Output:** The **Schedule Management Plan** document.
    - **Purpose:** This document details the methodology for how the project schedule will be managed, including how activities will be defined and estimated (resources, durations), how the schedule will be reported to stakeholders, and any assumptions or potential risks.
    - **Role:** Serves as a **guidebook or playbook** for the project manager throughout the project.

2.  **Define Activities**

    - **Process:** Breaking down each project component or work package into specific, well-defined, and itemised activities. This is the second process in schedule management.
    - **Inputs:**
      - **Project Scope:** The work required to successfully meet the project's deliverables.
      - **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Provides detail on all parts and components to be delivered. It serves as a guide for activity development.
      - **Work Packages:** Components broken down further from the WBS, essentially "mini-projects" within the larger project, which are then broken into individual activities.
    - **Outputs:**
      - **Activity List:** A comprehensive list of project activities.
      - **Activity Attributes:** Details about each activity, including **dependencies**.
      - **Project Milestones:** Significant events in the project that need to be met.

3.  **Sequence Activities**

    - **Process:** Defining the **order** in which project activities need to be performed.
    - **Dependencies:** Some activities are **dependent** on others, meaning one activity must be completed before another can begin (e.g., cannot assemble a product until raw materials are purchased). Software is often used for this.
    - **Types of Dependencies:**
      - **Mandatory Dependency:** An activity _must_ happen before another, with no alternative (e.g., a wall must be built before it can be painted).
      - **Discretionary Dependency:** An activity _should_ happen before another, but it's not strictly necessary (e.g., painting a wall before moving in furniture).
      - **External Dependency:** A dependency that originates _outside_ the project (e.g., a paint supplier delivering paint).
      - **Internal Dependency:** A dependency that originates _within_ the project (e.g., painters finishing one room before starting another).
    - **Precedence Diagramming (Network Diagramming):** A tool used by project managers to visually determine relationships between activities and develop the formal schedule, helping examine dependencies and identify the critical path.
      - **Nodes:** Represent individual activities.
      - **Arrows:** Represent dependencies between activities.
      - **Four Types of Precedence Relationships:**
        - **Finish-to-Start (FS):** Activity A must finish before Activity B can start (e.g., preparing dirt before digging a hole). This is a very common dependency type.
        - **Finish-to-Finish (FF):** Both activities should finish at the same time (e.g., tomatoes harvested and salad assembled concurrently).
        - **Start-to-Start (SS):** Activity A must start before Activity B can start, often done simultaneously (e.g., plowing land starts before planting seeds).
        - **Start-to-Finish (SF):** Activity A must start before Activity B can finish (rarely used).
    - **Leads and Lags:**
      - **Lead Time:** An overlap in the schedule where an activity can be partially started before its predecessor is fully complete; something being waited for, but accounted for in an overlap (e.g., ordering an engine a year before installation).
      - **Lag Time:** A deliberate delay or waiting period _after_ one activity is complete but _before_ the next dependent activity can begin (e.g., waiting two days for concrete to cure before driving on it).

4.  **Estimate Activity Durations**

    - **Process:** Determining how long each individual activity will take, considering all assigned resources. These estimates are crucial for developing the overall project schedule.
    - **Estimation Inputs:** Historical information from similar projects, expert consultation, or industry standards.
    - **Factors Impacting Estimates:**
      - **Law of Diminishing Returns:** Adding more resources to an activity beyond a certain point will not proportionally reduce the time needed and may even have a negative impact (e.g., a 10% increase in hours only yields a 5% increase in output).
      - **Adding Resources:** Doubling resources doesn't necessarily halve completion time due to learning curves for new people, increased risk of error, or simply having too many people on an activity.
      - **Technology:** Increased technological capacity often leads to increased productivity.
      - **Motivational Factors:**
        - **Student Syndrome (Procrastination):** People tend to apply themselves at the last possible minute to accomplish tasks.
        - **Parkinson's Law:** Work expands to fill the time available for its completion (e.g., a one-day task takes a full week if a week is allocated).
    - **Common Estimating Techniques:**
      - **Analogous Estimating:**
        - Uses **historic data** from similar past projects and expert judgment.
        - **Least time-consuming** but can be **less accurate**.
        - Useful in early planning stages with limited information. Accuracy depends heavily on the similarity of projects and reliability of data.
      - **Parametric Estimating:**
        - Uses an **algorithm** to calculate cost or duration based on historical data and specific project parameters (e.g., cost per unit, duration per unit).
        - Provides **more accuracy** due to detailed data analysis and mathematical calculations.
        - Can be scaled to different project sizes and complexities.
      - **Three-Point Estimating:**
        - Incorporates **risk scenarios** by using a range of estimates.
        - Includes an **Optimistic Estimate (O)** (best case), a **Most Likely Estimate (ML)** (realistic view), and a **Pessimistic Estimate (P)** (worst case).
        - Formula: **Estimate = (Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 3**.
      - **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) Estimating:**
        - Similar to three-point but gives **more weight to the most likely scenario**.
        - Formula: **PERT Estimate = (Optimistic + (4 \* Most Likely) + Pessimistic) / 6**.
      - **Bottom-Up Estimating:**
        - **Aggregates estimates** from the lowest-level components of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
        - Involves breaking the project into smaller, manageable tasks and estimating each individual component.
        - Provides **accurate, detailed, and comprehensive** estimates, ensuring no tasks are overlooked.
        - **More time-consuming** than other approaches, especially for many tasks.
        - Requires accurate input from subject matter experts (SMEs).
        - Ideal when scope is well-defined, accuracy is critical, and SMEs are available.
    - **Decision-Making for Estimates:**
      - Project managers should work with their team for duration estimates, as team members are often experts.
      - **Fist of Five:** A decision-making technique, often used in Agile, where team members vote on their confidence in an estimate. A closed fist means no support, five fingers mean full support. If less than three fingers are shown, concerns are voiced until consensus (three or more fingers) is reached.

5.  **Develop Schedule**
    - **Process:** Taking all information from sequencing and estimation steps to create a **formal project schedule**.
    - **Critical Path:** The shortest possible time the project takes to be completed; the **minimum amount of time necessary**. It is the **longest total duration of activities** through the network diagram. Activities on the critical path **cannot be delayed** without delaying the entire project.
    - **Schedule Constraints:** Restrictions that must be considered when developing the schedule.
      - **Must Start On/Must Finish By:** Most restrictive, client-driven dates (e.g., software update during a three-week shutdown).
      - **Start No Earlier/No Later:** Dates for starting a project/portion based on other events/dependencies.
      - **Finish No Earlier/No Later:** Similar dependencies for other events or projects.
      - **Resource Access:** Availability of specific personnel or resources.
      - **Profit/Market Timing:** Strategic launch dates to maximise profit or be first to market.
      - **Regulatory Compliances:** Time needed for testing or meeting specific rules.
    - **Potential Risks to Schedule:**
      - **Competing Projects:** Other projects within the organisation that might consume resources or funding.
      - **Catastrophic Events:** Unpredictable events (earthquakes, wildfires) that can be mitigated by seasonal planning.
      - **Labor Shortages:** Difficulty attracting and retaining adequate labor.
      - **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Global shortages requiring careful planning of lead times.
    - **Network Diagramming (PDM) for Schedule Development:**
      - A **visual or graphical representation** of the sequence of activities.
      - Helps find the earliest and latest possible completion dates for the project and identify efficiencies.
      - **Node Information for Forward/Backward Pass:**
        - **Activity Number:** In the centre of the node.
        - **Early Start (ES):** The earliest day an activity can begin, usually the predecessor's early finish day plus one.
        - **Early Finish (EF):** The earliest day an activity can be completed, calculated as ES + Duration - 1.
        - **Late Finish (LF):** The latest day an activity must finish without delaying the overall project.
        - **Late Start (LS):** The latest day an activity can begin without delaying the overall project, calculated as LF - Duration + 1.
      - **Forward Pass:** Calculates the Early Start and Early Finish dates for all activities by moving chronologically through the network diagram.
      - **Backward Pass:** Calculates the Late Finish and Late Start dates by working backward from the project's overall completion date.
      - **Float (Slack):** The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the entire project's finish date.
        - Calculated as (Late Finish - Early Finish) or (Late Start - Early Start) for a particular activity.
        - Activities on the **critical path have zero float**.
    - **Schedule Baseline:** Once durations, critical path, and float are determined, the **schedule baseline** is developed.
      - It is the **approved version of a schedule model** that can only be changed through formal change control procedures.
      - Serves as a **basis for comparison** to actual results.
      - Includes baseline start and finish dates and is approved by stakeholders.
    - **Gantt Chart:** A common tool used to **graphically communicate the project schedule** to stakeholders.
      - Shows activities, their start and finish dates, durations, and project milestones.
      - Often created using project management software or spreadsheet applications like Google Sheets templates.

#### B. Monitoring & Controlling Group Processes:

1.  **Control Schedule**
    - **Process:** The project manager ensures the project is progressing according to the plan. This process occurs **throughout the life of the project**.
    - **Actions:** If project dates slip or deadlines are at risk, the project manager takes **corrective actions** to get the project back on schedule. This may involve **schedule compression** techniques.

## Project Costing and Procurement Management: Key Concepts

### 1. Project Cost Management

- **Definition:** Project Cost Management is a **knowledge area** within project management that encompasses all processes to **plan the budget, estimate activity costs, and manage and control the project budget**.
- **Importance:** Estimating and controlling costs are critical for delivering a project to **scope, on schedule, and on budget**.
- **Overall Project Cost:** The sum of all its activities.
- **Processes:** This knowledge area contains **four processes** spread across the **Planning** and **Monitoring & Controlling** process groups.

#### A. Planning Group Processes:

1.  **Plan Cost Management**

    - **Purpose:** To create a framework for how project costs will be planned, estimated, and controlled throughout the project.
    - **Output:** The **Cost Management Plan** document.
    - **Team Involvement:** The project team will need to estimate project costs.

2.  **Estimate Costs**

    - **Methods:** Project managers and teams can use various methods:
      - **Historical information** from similar past projects.
      - **Consulting with suppliers**.
      - **Estimation techniques** based on industry standards (discussed in detail later).

3.  **Determine Budget**
    - **Process:** Taking all information from the cost estimating process to develop the project budget.
    - **Cost Baseline:** Establishes a **cost baseline** which serves as the **initial measurement** against which all future project costs will be compared.
    - **Funding:** The project budget should include all necessary funds for successful project execution through its life.

#### B. Monitoring & Controlling Group Processes:

1.  **Control Costs**
    - **Purpose:** Project managers continuously **monitor and control the budget** once approved and the project is progressing.
    - **Method:** Comparing actual expenditures to the baseline budget.
    - **Tools:** Uses **Earned Value Management (EVM)** tools to track the budget and communicate with stakeholders.

### 2. Estimating Project Cost: Types, Accuracy, and Techniques

#### A. Accuracy Levels of Estimates

- **Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Estimate:**
  - **Accuracy:** -25% to 75%.
  - **Use:** Very rough, used at the **beginning of the project** for an educated guess when detail is limited. Should be replaced by more accurate estimates later.
- **Budget Estimate:**
  - **Accuracy:** -10% to 25%.
  - **Use:** More refined, useful for **planning the project** and often used in the decision to approve the project.
- **Definitive Estimate:**
  - **Accuracy:** -5% to 10%.
  - **Use:** Most accurate, developed when the project is **planned in detail** and a thorough analysis of activities and costs has been done.

#### B. Types of Costs

- **Direct Costs:**
  - **Definition:** Easily assigned or billed directly to a project.
  - **Examples:** Project team wages (if 100% dedicated to the project), materials needed to build the deliverable.
- **Indirect Costs:**
  - **Definition:** Cannot be easily associated with a single project; resources are shared across multiple projects.
  - **Examples:** Quality control, PMO office costs, corporate tech support.
- **Fixed Costs:**
  - **Definition:** Do not usually change over time or with the number of units produced.
  - **Examples:** Lease payments for a building, monthly software subscriptions.
- **Variable Costs:**
  - **Definition:** Change proportionally to the amount of output produced. The more output, the higher the cost.
  - **Examples:** Material cost for each unit produced.
- **Important Relationships:**
  - A cost can be **either direct or indirect, but not both**.
  - A cost can be **either fixed or variable, but not both**.
  - A cost can be **both direct and variable** (e.g., dedicated assembly line workers whose numbers increase with output).

#### C. Cost Estimating Tools and Techniques

- Many of these techniques are the **same as those used for estimating activity duration**.
- **Analogous Estimating (Top-Down Estimating):**
  - **Method:** Uses **historical information** from similar past projects and expert judgment to determine costs.
  - **Characteristics:** **Less time-consuming** but can be **less accurate**. Provides a broad estimation.
  - **Example:** If a 1,000 sq ft manufacturing space conversion cost $500,000, a 2,000 sq ft conversion would be estimated at $1,000,000.
- **Parametric Estimating:**
  - **Method:** Uses a **mathematical modeling based estimation technique** based on a specific parameter (e.g., cost per unit, per hour) and historical information. Adjusts for size or scope.
  - **Characteristics:** Provides **more accuracy** due to data analysis and mathematical calculations.
  - **Example:** If a programmer costs $800 per day and is needed for 6 days, the estimated cost is $4,800 ($800 x 6).
- **Bottom-Up Estimating:**
  - **Method:** Breaks down the project into the lowest-level components of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and **estimates every single activity**. Includes all cost types (direct/indirect, fixed/variable).
  - **Characteristics:** **More time-consuming** but much more **precise and detailed**.
- **Three-Point Estimating:**
  - **Method:** Uses Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to define **Optimistic (O), Most Likely (ML), and Pessimistic (P)** cost scenarios.
  - **Formula:** **Estimate = (Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 3**.
  - **Example:** O=$4,000, ML=$8,000, P=$15,000 → Estimate = ($4,000 + $8,000 + $15,000) / 3 = $9,000.
- **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) Estimating:**
  - **Method:** Similar to three-point, but puts **more weight on the most likely scenario**.
  - **Formula:** **PERT Estimate = (Optimistic + (4 \* Most Likely) + Pessimistic) / 6**.
  - **Example:** O=$4,000, ML=$8,000, P=$15,000 → PERT Estimate = ($4,000 + (4 \* $8,000) + $15,000) / 6 = $8,500. The PERT estimate ($8,500) is closer to the Most Likely ($8,000) than the three-point estimate ($9,000).

### 3. Developing the Project Budget

- **Project Budget:** The **total projected costs** needed to complete the project scope within the project schedule; all authorized funds used to execute the project from start to finish.
- **Cost Performance Baseline (Cost Baseline / BAC):**
  - **Definition:** The **approved version of the budget** that includes contingency reserves.
  - **Function:** Serves as the **baseline for measuring project performance** throughout the project. It allows comparison of actual expenditures to gauge performance (e.g., behind budget, meeting milestones).
  - **Components:** Sum of all project activity costs + any contingency reserves for known project risks.
  - **Alias:** Also known as the **Budget At Completion (BAC)**.
  - **Visualisation:** Often graphed against time, showing cumulative project expenditure.
  - **Usage:** Used to forecast funding requirements and measure project performance in terms of expenditures and completion level.
- **Contingency Reserves:**
  - **Purpose:** An additional amount added to the cost of an activity or work package to cover **known risks** associated with that activity.
  - **Application:** Can be for specific work packages (e.g., 2-5% for anticipated supply chain issues like expedited shipping fees) or a general reserve (e.g., 5-10% overall).
  - **Importance:** Crucial to include as it's unrealistic to anticipate no problems. Can also be applied to project schedules for potential delays.
- **Management Reserve:**
  - **Purpose:** An amount of money held **outside the cost performance baseline** for **unknown risks or uncertainty**.
  - **Control:** Not controlled by the project manager; it's controlled by **management, the sponsor, or the PMO**.
  - **Access:** Requires going through a formal change process to access these funds.
- **Total Project Budget:**
  - **Formula:** **Cost Baseline + Management Reserve**.
  - This represents the complete authorised funds for the project, accounting for both known and unknown risks.

### 4. Project Procurement Management

- **Definition:** The **knowledge area** that contains the processes allowing project managers to **purchase or acquire products or services from outside the project team**. This applies when resources (materials or people/expertise) are not available in-house.
- **Key Questions for Procurement:** What is needed? When is it needed? Make or buy? Who will supply it? How to contract? How to maintain vendor relationships?.
- **Processes:** Contains **three processes** across the **Planning, Executing, and Monitoring & Controlling** process groups.

#### A. Planning Group Processes:

1.  **Plan Procurement Management**
    - **Purpose:** To create a document detailing all activities for the procurement process.
    - **Output:** The **Procurement Management Plan**.
    - **Content:** Specifies if requests will be sent out to bid, to whom, any constraints, stakeholder roles, and criteria for measuring competitive bids from suppliers.

#### B. Executing Group Processes:

1.  **Conduct Procurements**
    - **Process:** Obtaining seller responses, contacting sellers, **selecting the seller**, and **awarding the contract**.
    - **Company Practices:** May involve preferred sellers/vendors, formal **Requests for Proposals (RFPs)**, or separate groups to review proposals and award contracts to reduce bias.

#### C. Monitoring & Controlling Group Processes:

1.  **Control Procurements**
    - **Process:** Managing vendor relationships, continuously measuring contract performance, making corrective actions, and **closing out contracts** (once fulfilled or canceled).
    - **Importance:** Managing vendor relationships is crucial for project success. Suppliers are seen as an extension of the team and vital stakeholders. Open communication is extremely important. Strong supplier relationships can drive new innovation.

### 5. Make or Buy Decisions

- **Definition:** Project managers often decide whether to **internally produce** (make) the resources needed or to **outsource** (buy) them from another company.
- **Considerations:** Weighs the costs of internally producing versus externally sourcing. This could involve equipment, people, or expertise.

### 6. Supplier Selection and Management Process

- **Importance:** Strategic supplier selection and a well-defined process are crucial for project success; suppliers become important stakeholders.
- **Key Documents for Bidding:**
  1.  **Statement of Work (SOW):**
      - **Purpose:** A detailed, legally binding document outlining the **scope of the project**, all project requirements, and contractual terms.
      - **Content:** Can include an introduction, purpose statement, scope statement, work location, schedule duration, types of tasks/deliverables, milestones, testing requirements, payment terms, and other important information.
      - **Clarity:** Must be comprehensive enough for vendors to understand project requirements and what they need to provide.
      - **Distinction:** Different from a Project Charter.
  2.  **Terms of Reference (TOR):**
      - **Purpose:** A description of the **technical requirements** of the request for proposal or bidding documents.
      - **Importance:** Especially vital for projects that are technical in nature, governmentally regulated, or require specific technical credentials.
      - **Content:** Includes project scope, schedule, engineering-related work, level of expertise expected from suppliers (e.g., licensed professionals), and any stakeholder interests like permits, standards, or regulations.
- **Request for Quote (RFQ) / Request for Proposal (RFP):** The formal document sent to potential suppliers as an **invitation to bid** on the contract.
- **Evaluation Phase:**
  - Receive quotes/bids from multiple suppliers.
  - Evaluate bids based on criteria such as supplier history, risk of using a new supplier, references, and quality.
- **Negotiation:** Back-and-forth discussions with potential suppliers on pricing, payment terms, and other aspects before final acceptance.
- **Contract Award:** The phase where the contract is awarded to the selected supplier for goods or services.
- **Performance and Delivery:** The supplier performs the work or supplies the goods, which can be a one-time delivery or ongoing over the project life.
- **Control and Monitor Phase:** Measures supplier performance, and includes corrective actions if issues arise. Communication is extremely important between buyer and supplier.

### 7. Contracts

- **Definition:** A **legally binding agreement** between parties that creates mutual obligations enforceable by law; essentially, a promise that can be enforced legally.
- **Elements of a Valid Contract:**
  1.  **Offer:** One party makes a specific promise.
  2.  **Consideration:** Something of value is promised in exchange for the offer (the value that makes parties enter the contract).
  3.  **Acceptance:** The offer is accepted, and parties agree to the offer and consideration.
  4.  **Mutuality (Meeting of the Minds):** Both parties understand and agree to the basic terms of the contract and have the authority to enter into it.
  5.  **Legality:** The contract's purpose and subject matter must be legal to be enforceable.
- **Types of Contracts and Associated Risks:** Different contract types carry different levels of risk for the buyer and the supplier.
  1.  **Fixed Price Contract:**
      - **Use:** When deliverables are clearly defined.
      - **Risk:** **Seller assumes more risk** because the price is fixed; if seller's costs increase, they cannot pass this on to the buyer. Buyer assumes less risk.
      - **Variants:**
        - **Fixed Price Incentive Contract:** Allows seller to receive more money for incentives (e.g., early delivery bonus).
        - **Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment:** Allows price adjustment if costs of materials or labor increase/decrease.
  2.  **Time and Material (T&M) Contract:**
      - **Use:** Popular for outsourcing labor and materials, especially when the buyer doesn't know the exact time needed (e.g., temporary employees for specific skills).
      - **Risk:** **Buyer assumes higher risk** because costs can quickly get out of hand if labor takes longer than expected.
  3.  **Cost Plus Contract:**
      - **Use:** When exact requirements are ambiguous or not clear.
      - **Risk:** **Buyer assumes higher risk** as they pay the actual cost incurred by the seller plus a predetermined fee. The supplier is not incentivized to finish early or on time since all costs are covered by the buyer.
  4.  **Retainer:**
      - **Use:** Buyer prepays a specific amount for a specific number of employee hours, often when the Statement of Work isn't very clear (e.g., for freelancers in the gig economy).
      - **Risk:** **Buyer assumes risk** as retainers are usually paid in advance of work completion.

### **Project Management: Comprehensive Crisp Notes**

**I. Core Concepts**

- **Project:** A **temporary effort that creates value** [Previous Transcript, T1]. It has a beginning and an end, is unique, initiates change, and results in a deliverable [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Temporary Nature:** Projects have start and end dates. They conclude when objectives are met, funding runs out, need ceases, or they are cancelled [Previous Transcript, T1]. Without an end date, it's considered **operations** (ongoing) [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Unique:** Projects fulfill a specific objective or create a new product/service [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Create Value:** Deliver tangible (e.g., rocket booster) or intangible (e.g., software update) value [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Management (Henri Fayol's Definition):** Functions include Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, and Controlling [Previous Transcript, T1]. Modern adaptation includes Planning, Organizing, **Leadership** (combining commanding and coordinating), and Controlling [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Project Management:** Applying specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to **deliver value** [Previous Transcript, T1]. PMI defines it as such [Previous Transcript, T1].

**II. Functions of Management (Detailed)**

- **Planning:** Setting direction, communicating goals, defining methods, steps, and resources [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Organizing:** Assembling resources (people, funding, equipment) to achieve goals [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Leading/Leadership:** Focusing on human aspects: hiring, managing, training, coaching, performance review, setting an example [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Controlling:** Verifying adherence to plan, schedule, and budget [Previous Transcript, T1].

**III. The Project Manager (PM) Role and Responsibilities**

- **Core Role:** Ultimate responsibility for project success [Previous Transcript, T1]. Connects people to resources and processes, sets direction, applies PM tools, and leads teams to deliver value [Previous Transcript, T1]. A good PM is a **problem solver** [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Key Activities:** Define tasks, develop plans, manage resources, establish metrics, communicate status, transfer project to client, document lessons learned [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Qualities:** Organized, passionate, goal-oriented, comfortable with change, drives change, leads others, culturally aware, servant leader, strong negotiation skills (especially in matrix orgs) [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Project Management Constraint Triangle (Iron Triangle):** Balances **Scope, Budget (Cost), Schedule (Time)**, with **Quality** as an overarching factor [Previous Transcript, T1]. Changes in one constraint impact others [Previous Transcript, T1]. PM's job is to balance these [Previous Transcript, T1]. Quality should not be compromised [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Managing Expectations:** A core PM responsibility, particularly for technical PMs [Previous Transcript, T1]. A well-defined scope helps a PM push back on out-of-scope requests or justify additional resources [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **"Overhead" Perception:** PMs can sometimes be seen as overhead because they facilitate work rather than directly performing technical tasks [Previous Transcript, T1].

**IV. Project Management Process Groups (5)**

These define **what a project manager does** chronologically in a traditional project [Previous Transcript, T1].

1.  **Initiating the Project:**
    - Define initial scope and identify stakeholders [Previous Transcript, T1]. Understand business environment, strategy, assets [Previous Transcript, T1]. Develop **business case** [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Project Charter (Key Document):** Prepared by PM or sponsor. **Justifies the project**, provides high-level overview, gives PM authority, aligns stakeholders [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - **Contents:** Justification, objectives/deliverables, measurable goals (requirements & constraints), stakeholders/team, high-level budget/ROI, milestones/timeline, potential risks, resources, approval requirements [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - It is the **first process in the Initiating phase** and belongs to **Project Integration Management** [Previous Transcript, T1].
2.  **Planning the Project:**
    - Define activities, duration, cost, resources, build schedule, identify/mitigate risks [Previous Transcript, T1]. Develop **scope of work**, detailed estimates, quality plans, communication strategy, and procurement plans [Previous Transcript, T1]. A good plan is vital for success [Previous Transcript, T1].
3.  **Executing the Project:**
    - Assemble team, set ground rules, procure resources, determine milestones [Previous Transcript, T1]. Much of the project's actual work occurs here [Previous Transcript, T1]. PM focuses on leading and developing the team [Previous Transcript, T1].
4.  **Monitoring and Controlling the Project:**
    - Ensure project stays on track, meets milestones and quality standards [Previous Transcript, T1]. Collect performance data, compare to metrics, implement risk mitigation, communicate status [Previous Transcript, T1]. Track, review, regulate progress; apply corrective actions [Previous Transcript, T1].
5.  **Closing the Project:**
    - Gain customer approval, hand over project, complete final documentation, write report, and share **lessons learned** [Previous Transcript, T1].

**V. Project Management Knowledge Areas (10)**

These define **what a project manager needs to know** [Previous Transcript, T1].

1.  **Integration Management:** Coordinates all project elements. **Most important** for informed decision-making and continuous throughout the lifecycle [Previous Transcript, T1]. The Project Charter falls under this [Previous Transcript, T1].
2.  **Scope Management:** Ensures **all and only** the required work for successful completion [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **PMI Definition:** Work required for deliverables, managing changes, staying on time/budget [Previous Transcript, T1]. Defines project boundaries (what you _will_ and _won't_ do) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Project Scope Statement:** Documented description of scope, deliverables, boundaries, responsibilities, estimates [Previous Transcript, T1]. Ensures stakeholder understanding [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Scope Management Plan:** Defines how change requests are handled, how WBS is developed, and how deliverables are approved [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Scope Creep:** Out-of-scope requests from stakeholders; PMs must avoid this, using formal change control if necessary [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Six Processes:**
      - _Planning:_ Plan Scope Management, Collect Requirements, Define Scope, Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - _Monitoring & Controlling:_ Validate Scope (stakeholder approval), Control Scope (prevent creep) [Previous Transcript, T1].
3.  **Schedule Management:** Ensures timely project completion [Previous Transcript, T1].
4.  **Cost Management:**
    - **Definition:** The knowledge area containing processes to **plan the budget, estimate activity costs, and manage/control the project budget**. It's crucial for delivering the project **on budget**.
    - **Overall Project Cost:** The sum of all its activities.
    - **Processes (4 across Planning and Monitoring & Controlling groups):**
      1.  **Plan Cost Management:** Create the **Cost Management Plan**, a document detailing how costs will be planned, estimated, and controlled.
      2.  **Estimate Costs:** Determine activity costs using historical information, supplier consultation, or industry standard techniques.
      3.  **Determine Budget:** Project manager takes cost estimates and establishes a **Cost Baseline**. The budget includes all necessary funds for project execution.
      4.  **Control Costs:** Continuously monitor and control the budget by comparing actual expenditures to the baseline budget. Uses **Earned Value Management (EVM)** tools.
    - **Types of Costs:**
      - **Direct Costs:** Easily assigned or billed directly to the project (e.g., project team wages if 100% dedicated, materials).
      - **Indirect Costs:** Cannot be easily associated with a single project; resources shared across multiple projects (e.g., quality control, PMO office, corporate tech support).
      - **Fixed Costs:** Do not usually change over time or with the number of units produced (e.g., lease payments, software licenses).
      - **Variable Costs:** Change proportionally to the amount of output produced (e.g., material cost for each unit).
      - **Important Note:** A cost is either direct OR indirect (not both), and either fixed OR variable (not both). However, a cost can be both **direct and variable** (e.g., additional assembly line workers for increased output).
    - **Types of Estimates (by accuracy):**
      1.  **Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM):** Very rough, used at the beginning of the project as an educated guess. Accuracy: **-25% to +75%**.
      2.  **Budget Estimate:** More refined, useful for project planning and approval decisions. Accuracy: **-10% to +25%**.
      3.  **Definitive Estimate:** Most accurate, developed when the project is planned in detail and activities/costs are thoroughly analysed. Accuracy: **-5% to +10%**.
    - **Estimation Tools & Techniques (similar to schedule estimation):**
      - **Analogous Estimating (Top-Down):** Uses historical information from similar past projects/activities. Faster but less accurate.
      - **Parametric Estimating:** Mathematical modeling based on specific parameters (e.g., cost per unit of measure like cubic yard, gallon, hour of labor) and historical data.
      - **Bottom-Up Estimating:** Estimates **every single activity** from the WBS (including all cost types), then aggregates for total project cost. More time-consuming but **much more precise**.
      - **Three-Point Estimating:** Uses Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for optimistic (O), most likely (M), and pessimistic (P) cost scenarios. Formula: **(O + M + P) / 3**.
      - **PERT Estimating:** Similar to Three-Point, but puts **more weight on the most likely scenario**. Formula: **(O + 4M + P) / 6**. Result is closer to the most likely estimate than Three-Point.
    - **Project Budget & Reserves:**
      - **Project Budget:** Total projected costs needed to complete the project, representing all authorized funds.
      - **Cost Performance Baseline (Cost Baseline / BAC - Budget At Completion):** Approved budget including contingency reserves, serving as the **baseline for measuring project performance** (e.g., against predicted milestones, actual expenditures). It forecasts funding requirements and measures performance.
      - **Contingency Reserves:** Additional amount added to activity costs to cover **known risks** (e.g., 2-5% for anticipated supply chain issues). Also applies to schedules. Important to include for realistic planning.
      - **Management Reserve:** Amount held **outside the cost baseline** for **unknown risks/uncertainty**. **Not controlled by the project manager** (controlled by management, sponsor, or PMO). Requires a change process to access.
      - **Total Project Budget Formula:** Cost Baseline + Management Reserve.
    - **Earned Value Management (EVM):** Tool used to track budget and communicate with stakeholders. Monitors project progress in terms of schedule and cost. (PMP exam requires formula memorization, but not for this course).
5.  **Quality Management:** Ensures deliverables satisfy needs; PMs measure quality and take corrective actions [Previous Transcript, T1].
6.  **Resource Management:** Identifies, acquires, and manages physical and human resources for project completion [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Resources:** Capital (equipment, land, buildings, funding, office space), Technology (software, data protection), and People (team members) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Six Processes:** Plan Resource Management, Estimate Activity Resources, Acquire Resources, Develop Team, Manage Team, Control Resources [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Tools:** Project organization chart, Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM), RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) Chart, Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Negotiating for Resources:** Crucial, especially when resources are scarce or schedule is compressed [Previous Transcript, T1].
7.  **Communications Management:** Ensures timely and secure generation, collection, sharing, and archiving of project knowledge. Poor communication is a major cause of project failure [Previous Transcript, T1].
8.  **Risk Management:** Identifies, analyses, and responds to project risks (e.g., schedule delays, resource loss) [Previous Transcript, T1].
9.  **Procurement Management:**
    - **Definition:** The knowledge area containing processes for project managers to **purchase or acquire products or services from outside the project team**. This applies when resources (materials, services, people) are not made internally or already on hand.
    - **Importance:** Projects create value through deliverables, which require resources. Procurement is essential when those resources must be externally sourced. PMs collaborate with procurement/purchasing offices.
    - **Processes (3 across Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling groups):**
      1.  **Plan Procurement Management:** PM creates the **Procurement Management Plan**, detailing procurement activities, constraints, stakeholder roles, and criteria for evaluating bids.
      2.  **Conduct Procurements:** Obtaining seller responses, contacting, selecting, and awarding contracts. May involve preferred vendors, formal RFPs, or third-party review for unbiased selection.
      3.  **Control Procurements:** Managing vendor relationships (communication, performance), corrective actions, and closing contracts (fulfilled or cancelled).
    - **Make or Buy Decisions:** Weighing costs of internal production versus external sourcing (equipment, personnel, expertise). The decision to outsource initiates the procurement process.
    - **Supplier Selection & Management:** Crucial for project success. Suppliers are important stakeholders. Requires strategic processes.
      - **Procurement Documents:**
        - **Statement of Work (SOW):** Detailed, legally binding overview of project scope, requirements, deliverables, timeline, invoicing, and payment terms.

        - **Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment:** Fixed price adjustable for material/labor cost changes.
        - **Time and Material (T&M) Contracts:** For outsourcing labor/materials when exact time is unknown. **Buyer assumes higher risk** (costs can get out of hand).
        - **Cost Plus Contract:** Buyer pays actual costs + predetermined fee for ambiguous requirements. **Buyer assumes risk** (supplier not incentivized to finish early/on time).
        - **Retainer:** Buyer prepays for specific employee hours when SOW is unclear. **Buyer assumes risk** (paid in advance).
    - **Supplier Relationship Management (SRM):** Crucial part of controlling procurements. Monitoring performance and actively managing relationships to drive innovation.
10. **Stakeholder Management:** Identifies and builds relationships with people/organizations impacted by the project [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Stakeholder:** Anyone with influence or power over the project, team, or outcome (customer, team, investors, suppliers, government) [Previous Transcript, T1].

    - **Stakeholder Analysis:** Identify early, determine interests/influence [Previous Transcript, T1]. Categorize by interest, influence, involvement [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Salience Model:** Classifies stakeholders by **Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency** into seven categories (e.g., Definitive stakeholders have all three and require most engagement) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Power Interest Grid (Most Common):** Classifies by **Power** (Y-axis) and **Interest** (X-axis) [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - **Players (High Interest, High Power):** Keep engaged, seek collaboration (e.g., sponsor, customer) [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - **Subjects (High Interest, Low Power):** Consult for insights, keep informed (e.g., key admin support) [Previous Transcript, T1].

      - **Crowd (Low Power, Low Interest):** Provide information, no feedback expected (e.g., website updates) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Relationship with Communications Management:** These two areas are intertwined; stakeholder management relies on effective communication and engagement [Previous Transcript, T1].

**VI. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

- **Definition:** A graphical tool that breaks down project deliverables into smaller **work packages** [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Purpose:** Identifies every project element, ensures all deliverables are detailed, and nothing is missed [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Structure:** Level one is the project deliverable, broken down into smaller components at level two and further into work packages [Previous Transcript, T1]. Broken down to the lowest level for accurate time, cost, and resource estimation [Previous Transcript, T1]. Tasks typically start with verbs [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Uses:** Project cost budgeting (estimating each component), project timing (building sequence, schedule, milestones), identifying dependencies, and determining the critical path [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **WBS Dictionary:** Adds context, describes work packages, detailing assumptions and interdependencies. Helps prevent scope creep and aids communication [Previous Transcript, T1].

**VII. Project Management Methodologies**

**VIII. Organisational Structures: Matrix Organisations**

- **Definition:** A management structure where employees report to **two or more bosses** (functional manager and project manager). Allows cross-functional work but adds complexity [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Traditional Structure:** Single chain of command, one manager [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Pros of Matrix:** Increases flexibility and productivity, efficient resource use (sharing, re-allocation), access to **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)** [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Cons of Matrix:** Complexity, challenging for team members with competing interests from two managers, competition for best resources, increased potential for conflict [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Balance of Power (Project Manager's Authority):**
  - **Weak Matrix:** PM has the **least power**, acts more as a **project coordinator**. Functional manager holds most managerial power [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Balanced Matrix:** Power is **shared equally**. Can be difficult for team members. PM typically has authority only over project-related tasks and allocated resources [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Strong Matrix:** PM has the **greatest power**, including a say in resource allocation for the entire project, often holding more power than the functional manager [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Negotiation Skills:** **Strong negotiation skills are necessary** for PMs in matrix organisations due to competition for internal resources [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Performance Appraisals:** PMs may have responsibility for deliverables but not the authority to evaluate team members' performance in matrix organisations [Previous Transcript, T1].

**IX. Project Team Development**

- **Importance:** Having the right people makes or breaks a project. PMs build, enhance, cultivate, and manage conflicts within teams, setting the tone [Previous Transcript, T1].
