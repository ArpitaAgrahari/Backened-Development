### **Project Management: Core Concepts & Methodologies - Notes**

**I. Defining Key Terms**

- **Project:** A **temporary effort that creates value**.
  - Examples: Developing a new app, building a skyscraper, planning an event.
  - Characteristics: Has a sequence of activities, specific time, specific budget, meets customer needs.
- **Management (Henri Fayol's Definition):** Functions managers perform.
  - Original functions: Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, Controlling.
  - Modern adaptation: Planning, Organizing, **Leadership** (combines commanding and coordinating), Controlling.
- **Project Management:** The use of specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to deliver something of value to people.
  - PMI defines it as using specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to deliver value.

**II. Characteristics of Projects**

Projects are distinct from ongoing operations and possess unique characteristics:

- **Temporary:** Have a beginning and an end date (start and finish).
  - End conditions: Objectives met, money runs out, no longer a need, or project is cancelled/terminated.
  - Without an end date, it's considered **operations** (ongoing and permanent).
  - Example: Building an assembly line is a project; manufacturing automobiles on it is operations.
- **Unique:** Fill a specific objective or create a new product/service.
  - Example: Creating a project management course.
- **Create Value:** Deliver value for an individual or organization.
  - Can improve existing products or services.
  - Outcome can be tangible (e.g., rocket booster) or intangible (e.g., software update, document).
  - Example: Hardware upgrade increases employee efficiency, reduces costs, or increases data security, thus creating value.
- **Initiate Change:** Bring on a change in the status quo for the company or customer.
  - Example: Hardware upgrade replacing obsolete systems.
- **Have a Deliverable:** Projects create something and have a deliverable.

**III. Functions of Management (Expanded)**

- **Planning:** Setting direction, communicating goals, defining methods, determining steps, knowing available resources and tools.
- **Organizing:** Bringing together resources (people, funding, equipment) to support end goals.
- **Leading/Leadership:** Focusing on the human aspect; hiring, managing, training, coaching, reviewing performance, setting an example.
- **Controlling:** Verifying everything works according to plan, schedule, and budget.

**IV. The Project Manager (PM) Role and Responsibilities**

Project Managers are central to project success.

- **What they do:**
  - Bring everything together; connect people to resources, set direction to accomplish goals.
  - Connect people to the process.
  - Have ultimate responsibility for project success.
  - Apply project management tools, lead and manage people to deliver completed projects and create value.
  - Use management skills to solve business problems or act on opportunities.
  - Define what needs to be done, detail tasks, develop plans, manage resources (people, facilities, supplies).
  - Develop metrics to measure implementation.
  - Consistently communicate project status to stakeholders.
  - Turn over the project to the customer/client/user upon completion.
  - Reflect and document lessons learned for future projects.
- **Qualities of a Project Manager:** Organized, passionate, goal-oriented, understand commonalities in projects and their strategic role.
  - Comfortable in ever-changing environments, drive change, lead others.
  - Master project management tools and techniques.
  - Ability to work with cross-functional teams.
  - Culturally aware and servant leaders.
  - A good project manager collaborates with the team to set ground rules for communication and scope changes.
  - A good project manager is a **problem solver**.
- **Managing Client Expectations:** A core responsibility, especially for technical project managers. This involves managing expectations around four key areas (often referred to as the "triple constraint" plus quality):
  1.  **Scope:** All requirements for the project (e.g., list of requirements for a house).
  2.  **Budget:** How much money is allocated for the project.
  3.  **Schedule:** How long it takes to complete the project.
  4.  **Quality:** Ensuring the deliverables are robust and usable (e.g., ensuring few bugs in software).
- **PM as "Overhead":** Some may perceive PMs as "overhead" because they ensure work gets done rather than completing configurations or setting things up themselves.

**V. Project Management Process Groups (5)**

These define **what a project manager does** and provide a chronological process.

1.  **Initiating the Project:**
    - Provide the scope for the project.
    - Ensure customer and stakeholder expectations are met.
    - Understand the business environment, company's strategic direction, strengths, weaknesses.
    - Deep understanding of company assets (tools, templates, lab/office space).
    - Develop the **business case** for the project.
    - Develop and share documents (e.g., **Project Charter**) that show the project's value, quantifying and communicating it to stakeholders.
    - First step: initial documentation and identifying project stakeholders.
2.  **Planning the Project:**
    - A well-defined process to project planning.
    - Define project activities, including duration, cost, and resources needed.
    - Build a project schedule.
    - Identify potential risks and plan to address/mitigate them before the project begins.
    - Detailed schedule and cost estimate, quality plans, corrective action activities.
    - Develop communication strategy to engage stakeholders and the team.
    - Identify how to purchase/acquire supplies and people.
    - **Crucial for success:** A good plan is vital, while a bad plan leads to an unsuccessful project.
3.  **Executing the Project:**
    - Bring together the project team.
    - Collaborate with the team to set ground rules and address scope changes.
    - Launch the project: procure necessary resources, determine milestones.
    - Much of the actual work of the project is done here.
    - PM's time is spent leading and developing the team.
4.  **Monitoring and Controlling the Project:**
    - Ensure the project is on track to meet milestones.
    - Ensure project performance and quality standards are met.
    - Collect performance data and compare to predetermined metrics.
    - Implement risk mitigation strategies (e.g., assigning more resources).
    - Communicate data and project status to stakeholders.
    - Track, review, regulate progress and performance.
    - Measure actual progress to predicted milestones and use corrective actions if behind schedule, over budget, or experiencing quality issues.
5.  **Closing the Project:**
    - Gain customer/client approval for meeting requirements.
    - Turn the project over to the client.
    - Final project documentation and writing a project report.
    - Reflect and share lessons learned to guide future projects.

**VI. Project Management Knowledge Areas (10)**

These define **what a project manager needs to know**.

1.  **Integration Management:**
    - Ensures proper coordination of various project elements.
    - **Most important** as it brings everything together for informed decision-making.
    - Occurs continuously across the entire project life cycle.
2.  **Scope Management:**
    - Ensures the project includes **all and only** the required work.
    - Define outputs and benefits; identify all project requirements.
    - Crucial for a clear understanding of project assumptions and constraints.
3.  **Schedule Management:**
    - Ensures project completion on time.
    - Helps the project run smoothly and efficiently; stakeholders need to know milestone dates.
4.  **Cost Management:**
    - Ensures project completion within the approved budget.
    - Important for proving a project's value.
5.  **Quality Management:**
    - Ensures the project satisfies the needs for which it was undertaken.
    - PMs measure quality continually and take corrective actions.
    - Requires a solid, data-driven plan for quality planning, control, and assurance.
6.  **Resource Management:**
    - Ensures effective use of people involved (often human resources).
    - One of the most challenging areas due to focus on people and performance.
    - Includes hiring, allocating people, and the PM serving as a leader.
7.  **Communications Management:**
    - Ensures project knowledge is generated, collected, shared, and archived timely and securely.
    - Poor communication is a major reason for project failure.
    - Ensures right messages reach right people at right time, in correct format/channel.
8.  **Risk Management:**
    - Identifies, analyses, and responds to project risks.
    - PM asks: What can go wrong? How to prevent it? What to do if it goes wrong?.
    - Risks can be to schedule (e.g., material shortages) or resources (e.g., losing a team member).
    - Provides tools to identify, categorize, quantify risks, and develop a response plan.
9.  **Procurement Management:**
    - Acquires goods and services from outside the organization.
    - Involves creating/maintaining vendor relationships, outsourcing for specific needs.
    - PM needs to understand the procurement process.
10. **Stakeholder Management:**
    - Identifies and develops relationships with people/organizations impacted by the project.
    - **Stakeholder:** Anyone with influence or power over the project, team, or outcome.
    - Examples: Customer, team members, investors, suppliers, government agencies.
    - PMs need a plan to keep stakeholders informed at each project lifecycle step.

**VII. Project Management Methodologies**

**A. Waterfall Project Management (Traditional/Predictive)**

- **Focus:** Developing a comprehensive plan and strictly following it.
- **When to use:** Requirements are **well known** and stable.
  - Examples: Building a house, building a bridge, manufacturing a plane.
  - Changes are expensive, especially with physical/tangible items.
- **Flow (sequential):** Called "waterfall" because it flows from one step to the next.
  1.  Gather all requirements at the beginning.
  2.  Create the design.
  3.  Develop or build the solution.
  4.  Test and validate.
  5.  Deploy.
- **Outcome:** Usually **one big outcome** or "big bang" at the end, after all phases are complete.
- **Planning Tools:** Generally uses a **traditional work breakdown structure (WBS)**.
  - Breaks down deliverables into tasks (starting with verbs) to the lowest level for estimation of time, cost, and resources.
  - Identifies dependencies and orders tasks to determine the critical path.
- **Measurement:** Measures against an original plan or **baseline** to track if ahead/behind schedule or within/over budget.

**B. Agile Project Management**

- **Focus:** Collaborative approach with the customer, adapting to evolving requirements.
- **When to use:** Requirements are **not as well known** or may change.
  - Originally developed for software development.
  - Good for innovative projects.
- **Collaboration:** Close work with the customer throughout the project to gather additional requirements.
- **Sprints:** Work is done in **time-boxes** called sprints.
  - A sprint is a set amount of time (e.g., 2 weeks, typically 1-4 weeks, consistent throughout the project) to accomplish specific work.
  - Part of the project is delivered **incrementally** after each sprint.
- **Backlog:** Uses a **product/project backlog** to gather and prioritize requirements.
  - Prioritizes items (must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, won't-haves).
  - Work for sprints is pulled from the highest priority items in the backlog.
- **Feedback Loop:** Increments are showcased to the customer for feedback; new requirements may be added to the backlog and reprioritized.
- **Resources:** Dedicated resources tend to work best.
- **Scrum:** A common **Agile approach** for executing projects, with specific roles.

**C. Hybrid Project Management**

- **Definition:** A combined approach, customising elements of both Waterfall and Agile.
- **Customisation:** Tailored to the organization's structure, culture, project needs, and team.
- **Application:** Can switch between methodologies for different phases or run them concurrently (e.g., Waterfall for hardware, Agile for software).
  - Example: Building a plane might use Waterfall for the physical aircraft (expensive changes) and Agile for software components (less expensive changes).

**VIII. Project Management Institute (PMI)**

- **Role:** Non-profit global professional organization that provides resources and training for project management.
  - Catalyst for advancing the profession.
  - Hosts local and virtual events for professional development.
- **Certification:** Offers the **Project Management Professional (PMP)** certification.
  - Well-known and recognized worldwide as a standard.
  - Not necessary but highly regarded.
- **PMBOK:** Maintains the **Project Management Body of Knowledge**, a foundational resource for effective project management.
  - Contains specific knowledge areas essential for certified PMs.

**IX. Processes (49)**

- There are 49 specific processes that define the **way** project managers accomplish tasks, or the tools and techniques they use.
- Each process fits into a specific process group and coordinates with a specific knowledge area.
- These processes are not individually detailed in the provided transcripts but are noted as being important and will be covered in future lessons/courses.

Here are crisp notes from the provided transcripts, designed to cover every possible important point for an MCQ-based test:

---

### **Project Management: Project Charter, Scope Management & Work Breakdown Structure - Crisp Notes**

**I. The Project Charter**

- **Definition:** A document, usually prepared by the project manager or project sponsor, that provides a high-level overview of the entire project.
- **Purpose:**
  - **Justifies the project** and explains **why it's needed**.
  - Tells the **story of the project** and paints a picture of why it's needed to **create value** for the organization.
  - Gives the **project manager the authority to get started** with the project.
  - Ensures **everyone is on the same page** regarding the project.
- **Placement in Process Groups and Knowledge Areas:**
  - It is the **first step in project work**.
  - It is the **first process in the Initiating phase** (or "initiating the project phase").
  - It belongs to the **Project Integration Management knowledge area**, which encompasses the entire project and is ongoing.
- **Key Areas Addressed (Five):**
  1.  **Justification:** Clearly states why the project is needed and how it creates value for the organization.
  2.  **Project Objectives and/or Deliverables:** What will be delivered, tied directly to company objectives.
  3.  **Measurable Goals (Requirements and Constraints):** What the project commits to deliver, and importantly, **what the project will _not_ accomplish** (exclusions).
  4.  **Stakeholders and Team Members:** Identifies who will be involved and helpful for success.
  5.  **High-level Budget/Financial Investment/ROI and Project Milestones/Overall Timeline:** Financial information (if known) and key dates.
- **Important Contents (Specific Details):**
  - Project Title.
  - Purpose or Description.
  - High-level Objectives, Requirements, and Deliverables.
  - Potential Risks.
  - Key Milestones.
  - Resources Needed for success.
  - Potential Stakeholders.
  - **Approval Requirements:** Defines what success looks like and **who signs off upon completion** of the project.
  - People: Project Manager, resources, project team members, and the project sponsor.

**II. Project Scope Management**

- **PMI Definition:** The work required to output a project's deliverable, including processes to manage scope changes and ensure the project remains on time and within budget. Changes should occur only through **formal change control procedures**.
- **Importance:**
  - **Defines what the project team will be delivering**.
  - Defines the **boundaries of the project** – **what you will do and, more importantly, what you _won't_ do**.
  - Essential for the project manager to **manage stakeholder and customer expectations**.
  - A well-defined project scope is a **tool for the project manager to push back on out-of-scope requests** or **justify additional resources** if the scope broadens or changes.
  - Lists the work that needs to be done to deliver the product or service to meet user requirements.
- **Project Scope Statement:**
  - A **documented description of the project's scope**, its specific deliverables, project boundaries, team responsibilities, cost estimates, and schedule estimates.
  - Its purpose is to **ensure all stakeholders understand the deliverables and major milestones**.
- **Scope Management Plan:**
  - Will define **how the project manager will handle requests for changes that are outside the scope**.
  - Details how the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be developed and the process for approving project deliverables.
- **Scope Creep:**
  - Requests from stakeholders for **changes that are outside the agreed-upon scope**.
  - Project managers must **avoid scope creep**. If changes are necessary, proper change control procedures should be followed.
- **The Project Management Constraint Triangle (or Iron Triangle):**
  - Shows that **scope, cost, and time are all interconnected**.
  - When you change one parameter, there are **implications for the other parameters**.
  - If changes are introduced, it can **throw the entire triangle out of balance**.
  - It is the **project manager's job to balance these constraints**.
  - **Quality** is also a critical factor and **should not be compromised** as a result of changing scope, schedule, or adding cost.
  - Example: If time is reduced, options include bringing in more resources, which **increases the overall cost**.
- **Six Processes of Project Scope Management:** These fall under the Project Management Knowledge Areas and Process Groups.
  - **Under Planning Process Group (4 processes):**
    1.  **Plan Scope Management:** Create the scope plan document containing the project scope statement, requirements, deliverables, and the process for handling change requests.
    2.  **Collect Requirements:** Determine client and stakeholder requirements (deliverables, budget, training needs, non-functional requirements) by working closely with all stakeholders.
    3.  **Define Scope:** Translate customer requirements into a detailed description of deliverables, project exclusions, and set project boundaries.
    4.  **Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Break down all project work into smaller **work packages**.
  - **Under Monitoring & Controlling Process Group (2 processes):** 5. **Validate Scope:** Deliverables and scope need to be **approved by the appropriate stakeholder or client** (e.g., sponsor or customer). This is an important step in initiating the project. 6. **Control Scope:** Project managers ensure the project stays within scope and **avoid scope creep**. If scope changes are needed, formal change control procedures must be followed.

**III. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

- **Definition:** A graphical form that shows your entire project by breaking down project elements into smaller units called **work packages**.
- **Purpose/Reasons for Breakdown:**
  - Identifies **every element of the project work**.
  - Each work package focuses on a **specific deliverable**.
  - Ensures **every deliverable is detailed and nothing is missed**.
- **Structure:**
  - **Level one is the project deliverable**.
  - **Level two breaks down each component into a smaller deliverable or process**.
  - Can be broken down into smaller chunks to assign responsibility or action to team members.
  - Break down to the **lowest level** for accurate estimation of time, cost, and resources.
- **Uses:**
  - **Project cost budgeting:** Each component of the WBS should be estimated for project costing.
  - **Project timing:** A good tool to build a project sequence, schedule, and its milestones.
- **WBS Dictionary:**
  - Adds **context to the WBS**.
  - Provides a **description of work packages**, detailing assumptions and explaining interdependencies.
  - Gives the project manager another tool to **prevent scope creep** and provide clear communications to stakeholders.

**IV. Project Management Software**

- Commercially available software programs provide templates for managing project scope, schedule, and budgeting applications.
- Companies must determine which program or template is best for their specific project.

Here are crisp notes from the provided transcripts, designed to cover every possible important point for an MCQ-based test focusing on Stakeholder Management and Communication:

### **Project Management: Stakeholder Management & Communication - Crisp Notes**

**I. Defining Stakeholders**

- **Definition:** Anyone who can **impact your project** or **be impacted by your project**.
- **Importance of Communication:** Vital for project success.
- **Varying Information Needs:** Some stakeholders need to know about the project throughout its lifecycle, while others only need information at specific key points.
- **Goal of Stakeholder Management:** To **manage their expectations** throughout the entire project so that project deliverables can be achieved on time, on budget, and within scope.

**II. Stakeholder Management Process Groups & Processes**

- Stakeholder management has **four processes** across **four different process groups**.
- The four processes are:
  1.  **Identify Stakeholders**
  2.  **Plan Stakeholder Management**
  3.  **Manage Stakeholder Engagement**
  4.  **Monitor Stakeholder Engagement**

**III. Types of Stakeholders**

1.  **Internal Stakeholders:** Employees of your company.
    - Have an interest in the success of your project.
    - Examples: Project sponsor, internal project team members, board members of the corporation.
2.  **External Stakeholders:** People who don't work for your company but have an interest in the project.
    - Examples: Investors, suppliers, community members where your project is taking place.
3.  **Clients:**
    - Include the customer who purchases the output of your project or service.
    - Can also mean the end-user.
4.  **Governmental or Regulatory Stakeholders:**
    - The government is a stakeholder in many projects, which must conform to local laws and regulations.
    - Examples: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for environmental concerns, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pharmaceutical development projects.

**IV. Stakeholder Analysis**

- **Why it's needed:** To **identify stakeholders early** and then **determine their interests and influence** on your project.
- **How to conduct analysis:** Categorizing and classifying stakeholders by:
  1.  Their **interest** in your project.
  2.  Their **influence** on your project or within the organization.
  3.  Their **level of involvement** in your project (how involved they want to be or are anticipated to be).
- **Main Goal:** To **manage their expectations** in the project.
- **Method:** Gather your team for a brainstorming session to identify all potential stakeholders. Create an inclusive list to plan engagement and communication throughout the project.
- **Techniques/Models:** The two popular models discussed are the Salience Model and the Power Interest Grid.

**V. Salience Model**

- **Evaluation Criteria:** Stakeholders are assigned to one of seven categories based on their levels of **Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency** with your project.
  - **Power:** Having a position of authority.
  - **Legitimacy:** Belonging within the project, having a vested interest.
  - **Urgency:** Having a critical need for the project to happen (or not happen), or being time-driven.
- **Seven Categories (based on overlaps of Power, Legitimacy, Urgency):**
  1.  **Discretionary:** Have **legitimacy** but no power or urgency.
      - Example: A local charity benefiting from a company volunteer day – has legitimacy and interest, but no power.
  2.  **Dependent:** Overlapping **urgency and legitimacy**, but no power.
      - Example: Restaurant owners impacted by a road closure from a construction project – have legitimacy and urgency, but no power. Need to be monitored as they might combine efforts to hamper progress.
  3.  **Demanding:** High **urgency**, but low power and legitimacy.
      - Example: A patron picketing outside a project site due to affected restaurant.
  4.  **Dangerous:** Possess **power and urgency**, but no legitimate connection to the project.
      - Example: Someone attempting to sabotage the project or destroy equipment.
  5.  **Dormant:** Have **power**, but no legitimacy or urgency.
      - Example: An executive not engaged in your project, but you still need to be aware of their opinions due to their power.
  6.  **Dominant:** Have **power and legitimacy**, but no urgency.
  7.  **Definitive:** Possess **power, legitimacy, and urgency**.
      - **Very important stakeholders**.
      - Examples: Project sponsor or project customer.
      - Require the **most engagement and collaboration**.
- **Non-stakeholders:** People who don't fit into any categories and for whom no plan is needed.

**VI. Power Interest Grid**

- **Most Common Tool** for stakeholder analysis.
- **Matrix Classification:** Stakeholders are classified by their level of **power** (Y-axis) and **interest** (X-axis) in the project outcomes.
- **Four Quadrants:**
  1.  **Players (High Interest, High Power) - Upper Right Quadrant:**
      - Examples: Project sponsor, customer, client.
      - **Strategy:** Keep them **engaged** in the project; seek their **collaboration**.
  2.  **Subjects (High Interest, Low Power) - Lower Right Quadrant:**
      - Example: A key administrative support person who is highly engaged and influential in parts of your project.
      - **Strategy:** **Consult them** for their insights and ideas; **keep them informed**.
  3.  **Context Setters (High Power, Low Interest) - Upper Left Quadrant:**
      - Have a lot of influence but only want **high-level facts** and don't dwell on details.
      - Example: Director of Engineering (if needing engineering support).
      - **Strategy:** Ensure they **remain satisfied** with the project's progress.
  4.  **Crowd (Low Power, Low Interest) - Lower Left Quadrant:**
      - Require communication about progress, but not at the same level as others.
      - **Strategy:** Provide information (e.g., via website or social media post), but **do not ask for feedback in return**.

**VII. Relationship with Communications Management**

- **Stakeholder management and communications management go hand in hand**.
- A solid plan for managing stakeholder expectations depends on the **level of communication and engagement** the project manager offers throughout the project.
- Project managers now have the tools to analyze stakeholder needs and develop a comprehensive communication strategy.

### **Project Management: Comprehensive Crisp Notes**

**I. Core Concepts**

- **Project:** A **temporary effort that creates value** [Transcript 1 (T1)]. It has a beginning and an end, is unique, initiates change, and results in a deliverable [T1].
  - **Temporary Nature:** Projects have start and end dates. They conclude when objectives are met, funding runs out, need ceases, or they are cancelled [T1]. Without an end date, it's considered **operations** (ongoing) [T1].
  - **Unique:** Projects fulfill a specific objective or create a new product/service [T1].
  - **Create Value:** Deliver tangible (e.g., rocket booster) or intangible (e.g., software update) value [T1].
- **Management (Henri Fayol's Definition):** Functions include Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, and Controlling [T1]. Modern adaptation includes Planning, Organizing, **Leadership** (combining commanding and coordinating), and Controlling [T1].
- **Project Management:** Applying specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to **deliver value** [T1]. PMI defines it as such [T1].

**II. Functions of Management (Detailed)**

- **Planning:** Setting direction, communicating goals, defining methods, steps, and resources [T1].
- **Organizing:** Assembling resources (people, funding, equipment) to achieve goals [T1].
- **Leading/Leadership:** Focusing on human aspects: hiring, managing, training, coaching, performance review, setting an example [T1].
- **Controlling:** Verifying adherence to plan, schedule, and budget [T1].

**III. The Project Manager (PM) Role and Responsibilities**

- **Core Role:** Ultimate responsibility for project success [T1]. Connects people to resources and processes, sets direction, applies PM tools, and leads teams to deliver value [T1]. A good PM is a **problem solver** [T1].
- **Key Activities:** Define tasks, develop plans, manage resources, establish metrics, communicate status, transfer project to client, document lessons learned [T1].
- **Qualities:** Organized, passionate, goal-oriented, comfortable with change, drives change, leads others, culturally aware, servant leader, strong negotiation skills (especially in matrix orgs) [T1, 23, 28, 33, 35].
- **Project Management Constraint Triangle (Iron Triangle):** Balances **Scope, Budget (Cost), Schedule (Time)**, with **Quality** as an overarching factor [T1]. Changes in one constraint impact others [T1]. PM's job is to balance these [T1]. Quality should not be compromised [T1].
- **Managing Expectations:** A core PM responsibility, particularly for technical PMs [T1]. A well-defined scope helps a PM push back on out-of-scope requests or justify additional resources [T1].
- **"Overhead" Perception:** PMs can sometimes be seen as overhead because they facilitate work rather than directly performing technical tasks [T1].

**IV. Project Management Process Groups (5)**

These define **what a project manager does** chronologically in a traditional project [T1].

1.  **Initiating the Project:**
    - Define initial scope and identify stakeholders [T1]. Understand business environment, strategy, assets [T1]. Develop **business case** [T1].
    - **Project Charter (Key Document):** Prepared by PM or sponsor. **Justifies the project**, provides high-level overview, gives PM authority, aligns stakeholders [T1].
      - **Contents:** Justification, objectives/deliverables, measurable goals (requirements & constraints), stakeholders/team, high-level budget/ROI, milestones/timeline, potential risks, resources, approval requirements [T1].
      - It is the **first process in the Initiating phase** and belongs to **Project Integration Management** [T1].
2.  **Planning the Project:**
    - Define activities, duration, cost, resources, build schedule, identify/mitigate risks [T1]. Develop **scope of work**, detailed estimates, quality plans, communication strategy, and procurement plans [T1]. A good plan is vital for success [T1].
3.  **Executing the Project:**
    - Assemble team, set ground rules, procure resources, determine milestones [T1]. Much of the project's actual work occurs here [T1]. PM focuses on leading and developing the team [T1].
4.  **Monitoring and Controlling the Project:**
    - Ensure project stays on track, meets milestones and quality standards [T1]. Collect performance data, compare to metrics, implement risk mitigation, communicate status [T1]. Track, review, regulate progress; apply corrective actions [T1].
5.  **Closing the Project:**
    - Gain customer approval, hand over project, complete final documentation, write report, and share **lessons learned** [T1].

**V. Project Management Knowledge Areas (10)**

These define **what a project manager needs to know** [T1].

1.  **Integration Management:** Coordinates all project elements. **Most important** for informed decision-making and continuous throughout the lifecycle [T1]. The Project Charter falls under this [T1].

    - **Project Scope Statement:** Documented description of scope, deliverables, boundaries, responsibilities, estimates [T1]. Ensures stakeholder understanding [T1].
    - **Scope Management Plan:** Defines how change requests are handled, how WBS is developed, and how deliverables are approved [T1].
    - **Scope Creep:** Out-of-scope requests from stakeholders; PMs must avoid this, using formal change control if necessary [T1].
    - **Six Processes:**
      - _Planning:_ Plan Scope Management, Collect Requirements, Define Scope, Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) [T1].
      - _Monitoring & Controlling:_ Validate Scope (stakeholder approval), Control Scope (prevent creep) [T1].
3.  **Schedule Management:** Ensures timely project completion [T1].
4.  **Cost Management:** Ensures project completion within budget [T1].
5.  **Quality Management:** Ensures deliverables satisfy needs; PMs measure quality and take corrective actions [T1].
6.  **Resource Management:** Identifies, acquires, and manages physical and human resources for project completion.
    - **Resources:** Capital (equipment, land, buildings, funding, office space), Technology (software, data protection), and People (team members).
    - **Six Processes:**
      - _Planning:_
        1.  **Plan Resource Management:** Determine how to estimate, acquire, and use physical resources, and lead the team. Results in a formal **Resource Management Plan**.
        2.  **Estimate Activity Resources:** Uses WBS to determine resources needed. Results in a **Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS)**.
      - _Executing:_ 3. **Acquire Resources:** Recruit team members, buy/rent equipment, get materials/supplies. 4. **Develop Team:** Improve individual/team performance, professional development, training, build trust/positive environment/culture, manage conflicts, reward performance. 5. **Manage Team:** Track/measure performance, provide feedback, manage team member changes, optimize performance, influence behavior.
      - _Monitoring & Controlling:_ 6. **Control Resources:** Focuses primarily on **physical resources** (PMs manage/lead people, but control physical assets). Ensures resources work as planned for timing and efficiency.
    - **Tools:** Project organization chart, Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM), RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) Chart, Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS).
    - **Negotiating for Resources:** Crucial, especially when resources are scarce or schedule is compressed.
7.  **Communications Management:** Ensures timely and secure generation, collection, sharing, and archiving of project knowledge. Poor communication is a major cause of project failure [T1].

    - **Goal:** Manage stakeholder expectations to achieve project deliverables [T1].
    - **Four Processes:** Identify Stakeholders, Plan Stakeholder Management, Manage Stakeholder Engagement, Monitor Stakeholder Engagement [T1].
    - **Types:** Internal (sponsor, team, board), External (investors, suppliers, community), Clients (customer, end-user), Governmental/Regulatory (IRS, EPA, FDA) [T1].
    - **Stakeholder Analysis:** Identify early, determine interests/influence [T1]. Categorize by interest, influence, involvement [T1].
    - **Salience Model:** Classifies stakeholders by **Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency** into seven categories (e.g., Definitive stakeholders have all three and require most engagement) [T1].
    - **Power Interest Grid (Most Common):** Classifies by **Power** (Y-axis) and **Interest** (X-axis) [T1].
      - **Players (High Interest, High Power):** Keep engaged, seek collaboration (e.g., sponsor, customer) [T1].
      - **Subjects (High Interest, Low Power):** Consult for insights, keep informed (e.g., key admin support) [T1].
      - **Context Setters (High Power, Low Interest):** Keep satisfied (e.g., Director of Engineering) [T1].
      - **Crowd (Low Power, Low Interest):** Provide information, no feedback expected (e.g., website updates) [T1].
    - **Relationship with Communications Management:** These two areas are intertwined; stakeholder management relies on effective communication and engagement [T1].

**VI. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

- **Definition:** A graphical tool that breaks down project deliverables into smaller **work packages** [T1].
- **Purpose:** Identifies every project element, ensures all deliverables are detailed, and nothing is missed [T1].
- **Structure:** Level one is the project deliverable, broken down into smaller components at level two and further into work packages [T1]. Broken down to the lowest level for accurate time, cost, and resource estimation [T1]. Tasks typically start with verbs [T1].
- **Uses:** Project cost budgeting (estimating each component), project timing (building sequence, schedule, milestones), identifying dependencies, and determining the critical path [T1].
- **WBS Dictionary:** Adds context, describes work packages, detailing assumptions and interdependencies. Helps prevent scope creep and aids communication [T1].

**VII. Project Management Methodologies**

- **A. Waterfall (Traditional/Predictive):**
  - **Focus:** Comprehensive plan followed strictly [T1].
  - **When to Use:** Requirements are **well known and stable** (e.g., building a house, bridge, plane) [T1]. Changes are expensive [T1].
  - **Flow:** Sequential phases: Requirements, Design, Develop/Build, Test, Deploy [T1].
  - **Outcome:** Usually **one big outcome** at the end [T1].
  - **Tools:** Uses traditional WBS [T1].
  - **Measurement:** Against an original plan or **baseline** [T1].
- **B. Agile:**

  - **Collaboration:** Close customer involvement throughout [T1].
  - **Sprints:** Work done in fixed **time-boxes** (typically 1-4 weeks), delivering increments after each sprint [T1].
  - **Backlog:** Uses a **product/project backlog** for gathering and prioritizing requirements. Work for sprints is pulled from high-priority items [T1].
  - **Feedback:** Increments are showcased to customer for feedback, leading to new requirements and reprioritization [T1].
  - **Scrum:** A common Agile approach [T1].
- **C. Hybrid:**
  - **Definition:** Combines elements of Waterfall and Agile, customised to specific project/organisation needs [T1].
  - **Application:** Can switch methodologies for different phases or run concurrently (e.g., Waterfall for hardware, Agile for software in a plane build) [T1].

**VIII. Organisational Structures: Matrix Organisations**

- **Definition:** A management structure where employees report to **two or more bosses** (functional manager and project manager). Allows cross-functional work but adds complexity.
- **Traditional Structure:** Single chain of command, one manager.
- **Pros of Matrix:** Increases flexibility and productivity, efficient resource use (sharing, re-allocation), access to **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)**.
- **Cons of Matrix:** Complexity, challenging for team members with competing interests from two managers, competition for best resources, increased potential for conflict.
- **Balance of Power (Project Manager's Authority):**
  - **Weak Matrix:** PM has the **least power**, acts more as a **project coordinator**. Functional manager holds most managerial power.
  - **Balanced Matrix:** Power is **shared equally**. Can be difficult for team members. PM typically has authority only over project-related tasks and allocated resources.
  - **Strong Matrix:** PM has the **greatest power**, including a say in resource allocation for the entire project, often holding more power than the functional manager.
- **Negotiation Skills:** **Strong negotiation skills are necessary** for PMs in matrix organisations due to competition for internal resources.
- **Performance Appraisals:** PMs may have responsibility for deliverables but not the authority to evaluate team members' performance in matrix organisations.

**IX. Project Team Development**

- **Importance:** Having the right people makes or breaks a project. PMs build, enhance, cultivate, and manage conflicts within teams, setting the tone.
- **Tuckman's Stages of Team Development (1960s, Bruce Tuckman):**
  1.  **Forming:** Team comes together.
  2.  **Storming:** Conflicts and differences emerge.
  3.  **Norming:** Team establishes norms, resolves conflicts.
  4.  **Performing:** High-functioning, efficient team.
  5.  **Adjourning:** Team or project ends (added more recently).

**X. Leadership and Power**

- **Leadership:** About **influence**, not just management. No single "right" style; may change based on situation.
- **French and Raven's Five Bases of Power (late 1950s):**
  1.  **Legitimate Power:** Derived from position or formal relationships (e.g., CEO, VP over intern).
  2.  **Reward Power:** Ability to give benefits for desired actions (e.g., return favour, thank you).
  3.  **Expert Power:** Based on individual's expertise, skill, or competence (e.g., reputation for website design).
  4.  **Referent Power:** Based on likability, strong relationships, and networking ability.
  5.  **Coercive Power:** Ability to punish or force compliance (e.g., reprimand, forced overtime). **Not a good power to use** as it leads to unhappy team members.
- **Common Leadership Styles:**
  - **Servant Leadership:** Puts team first, empowers, develops members, focuses on needs.
  - **Autocratic Leadership:** Maintains control, doesn't seek input, makes decisions based on own judgment.
  - **Democratic Leadership:** Seeks input from the group, shared leadership.
  - **Charismatic Leadership:** Self-confident, inspires others, enthusiastic, personality-driven.
  - **Directing Leadership:** Lays out clear process, offers specific direction (good for new employees).
  - **Transactional Leadership:** Rewards success, punishes failure, based on rules/regulations.
  - **Transformational Leadership:** Encourages/inspires team to exceed expectations.
  - **Laissez-faire Leadership:** Hands-off, allows team to set goals and make decisions.

**XI. Motivation Theories**

- **General Concept:** Needs motivate behaviors to satisfy those needs.
- **Two Categories:**
  - **Content Theories:** Focus on **what** motivates us (needs, aspirations).
  - **Process Theories:** Focus on **how** motivation occurs (the process by which motivation happens).
- **Content Theories:**
  - **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:** Five levels in a hierarchy: Physiological, Safety, Social, Esteem, Self-Actualization. Lower needs must be met before moving to higher ones.
  - **Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory:**
    - **Motivators:** Encourage harder work if present (e.g., interesting job).
    - **Hygiene Factors:** Cause unmotivation if _not_ present (e.g., poor working conditions, poor pay).
  - **Three Needs Theory:** Three needs exist on a scale: Achievement, Affiliation (collaboration, group belonging), Power. Managers can use to set tailored motivational targets.
  - **McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y:**
    - **Theory X:** Assumes employees are lazy, unmotivated, avoid work; requires control/supervision.
    - **Theory Y:** Assumes employees are ambitious, self-motivated; perform well if provided with the right conditions.
  - **ERG Theory (Alderfer):** Simplified Maslow's. Three hierarchical needs: Existence (physical well-being), Relatedness (to others), Growth (personal development, meaningful work).
  - **Mayo's Motivation Theory:** Group performance depends on **norms** (positive/negative behavior) and **group cohesiveness** (getting along). High cohesiveness + positive norms = highest motivation/performance. Mayo was first to recognise good employee treatment leads to productivity.
- **Process Theories:**
  - **Adam's Equity Theory:** High motivation when treatment is perceived as fair relative to others. Individuals adjust inputs (work done) to compensate for perceived unfairness of outputs (pay).
  - **Vroom's Expectancy Theory:** Behavior chosen based on expected results. Three factors for motivation: **Expectancy** (effort leads to achievable targets), **Instrumentality** (hitting targets leads to reward), **Valence** (value/want the reward). Motivation is higher if these factors are high.
  - **Taylor's Scientific Management (Motivation Aspect):** Believed employees are only motivated by **money**. Workers don't inherently enjoy work, so employers must monitor closely to ensure efficiency.
  - **Self-Efficacy Theory:** Task-specific motivation. Higher self-efficacy (belief in performing a task) leads to more motivation. Four factors: Experience, Vicarious experience (seeing others succeed), Social persuasion (encouragement), Physiological feedback (ease with task).
  - **Reinforcement Theory:** Four factors influence motivation (encourage good, discourage bad behavior):
    - **Positive Reinforcement:** Reward for desired behavior.
    - **Negative Reinforcement:** Reward by removing something negative.
    - **Punishment:** Threat of negative consequence to stop undesirable behavior.
    - **Extinction:** Stopping learned behavior by withholding positive reinforcement.
  - **Locke's Goal-Setting Theory:** Setting the right goals increases motivation and productivity. Right goals must have: **Clarity, Challenge** (but not too much), **Commitment, Feedback**, and appropriate **Task Complexity**.

**XII. Emotional Intelligence (EQ)**

- **Definition:** Awareness and recognition of one's own emotions, and those of team members. Helps use emotions for the good of the team.
- **Daniel Goleman's Four Categories (1995):**
  1.  **Self-awareness:** Understanding one's own emotions, drives, strengths, weaknesses.
  2.  **Self-management:** Managing one's emotions and behavior.
  3.  **Social awareness:** Tuning into others, recognising/understanding emotions, empathy.
  4.  **Relationship management:** Applying emotional understanding in communication and collaboration.

**XIII. PMI Global Megatrends (Since 2020)**

- PMI report studying workplace changes due to technology, demographics, globalization complexities. Six large global megatrends:
  1.  **Acceleration of the Digital World:** Digital transformation (ML, AI, Cloud, IoT) enabling remote work and global collaboration.
  2.  **Climate Crisis:** PMI predicts sustainability practices must be built into every project/process to combat climate change.
  3.  **Shifting Demographics of the Workforce:**
      - 25 million new PM professionals needed in 8 years (talent gap).
      - **Great Resignation:** People resigning/changing jobs in record numbers (coined during pandemic).
      - Suggestions: Incorporate technology to reduce PM workload, recruit younger workers.
  4.  **Disruption in the Supply Chain & Economic Shifts:**
      - Historic labor shortage (early 2020s), made complex by women/minorities leaving workforce due to pandemic and not returning (disillusioned by work-life balance).
      - PMI suggests stronger cross-border collaborations for knowledge sharing and global recovery.
      - Organisations need to reset the employer-employee relationship to retain good employees.
  5.  **People Want More from Companies:** Workers desire to work for companies with a positive social impact, and want individual contributions recognized and rewarded.
  6.  **Demand for Equity (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - DEI):**
      - Systematic integration of DEI for a more equitable workforce.
      - Includes equal pay for women/ethnic minorities, inclusion for disabled employees, safe spaces for LGBTQ employees.
      - PMI suggestions: Embed DEI in every function/process, engage employees in policy/goal creation, form resource groups, recruit/retain diverse talent, cultivate inclusive culture.

**XIV. Innovative Teams & Diversity/Inclusion**

- **Pressure:** Organisations face increasing pressure to cultivate diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environments.
- **Business Case for Diversity:** Leads to stronger innovation, improved employee retention, better financial outcomes (e.g., higher procurement ROI), and attracts job seekers who value inclusion. Societal expectations are also driving corporate strategies.
- **Key Challenges:**
  - **Narrow Focus on Representation:** Often only addresses demographic diversity in hiring, not career advancement, mentorship, or leadership roles.
  - **Overly Simplistic Approaches:** Treats individuals as broad demographic groups, ignoring personal/professional nuances.
  - **Lack of Integration:** Viewed as compliance, not a fundamental business driver for innovation or market expansion.
- **Strategic Shifts for Leaders (BCG Recommendations):**
  1.  **Expand Scope of Workforce Inclusion Efforts:** Beyond demographics, recognise intersectionality of identities, address full employee experience (recruitment to leadership), develop policies for functional (pay equity) and emotional (feeling valued) satisfaction.
  2.  **Embed Inclusive Practices Across Business Operations:** Leverage diversity for innovation (products for underserved communities), expand supplier diversity, partner with external stakeholders for systemic change.
  3.  **Use Data-Driven Metrics to Measure Impact:** Assess representation, inclusion, progression, retention; align with business objectives (financial, customer, market); enhance transparency, hold leadership accountable.
  4.  **Amplify the Role of Business in Societal Change:** Leadership in promoting inclusion builds brand loyalty, attracts talent, aligns with ESG criteria, supports diverse entrepreneurs.
- **Overall Shift:** From treating inclusion as a compliance requirement to embedding it as a core driver of business success for competitive advantage.

**XV. PMI (Project Management Institute)**

- **Role:** Non-profit global professional organization, provides resources and training, advances the profession [T1].
- **Certification:** Offers the **Project Management Professional (PMP)** certification, a globally recognized standard [T1].
- **PMBOK:** Maintains the **Project Management Body of Knowledge**, a foundational resource [T1].

**XVI. Processes (49)**

- There are 49 specific processes (tools/techniques) for PMs. Each fits into a process group and knowledge area [T1].

**XVII. Project Management Software**

- Commercial software provides templates for managing scope, schedule, and budgeting. Companies must choose appropriate tools [T1].

Here are crisp notes from all the provided transcripts, designed to cover every possible important point for an MCQ-based test:

### **Project Management: Comprehensive Crisp Notes**

**I. Core Concepts**

- **Project:** A **temporary effort that creates value** [T1]. It has a beginning and an end, is unique, initiates change, and results in a deliverable [T1].
  - **Temporary Nature:** Projects have start and end dates. They conclude when objectives are met, funding runs out, need ceases, or they are cancelled [T1]. Without an end date, it's considered **operations** (ongoing) [T1].
  - **Unique:** Projects fulfill a specific objective or create a new product/service [T1].
  - **Create Value:** Deliver tangible (e.g., rocket booster) or intangible (e.g., software update) value [T1].
- **Management (Henri Fayol's Definition):** Functions include Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, and Controlling [T1]. Modern adaptation includes Planning, Organizing, **Leadership** (combining commanding and coordinating), and Controlling [T1].
- **Project Management:** Applying specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to **deliver value** [T1]. PMI defines it as such [T1].

**II. Functions of Management (Detailed)**

- **Planning:** Setting direction, communicating goals, defining methods, steps, and resources [T1].
- **Organizing:** Assembling resources (people, funding, equipment) to achieve goals [T1].
- **Leading/Leadership:** Focusing on human aspects: hiring, managing, training, coaching, performance review, setting an example [T1].
- **Controlling:** Verifying adherence to plan, schedule, and budget [T1].

**III. The Project Manager (PM) Role and Responsibilities**

- **Core Role:** Ultimate responsibility for project success [T1]. Connects people to resources and processes, sets direction, applies PM tools, and leads teams to deliver value [T1]. A good PM is a **problem solver** [T1].
- **Key Activities:** Define tasks, develop plans, manage resources, establish metrics, communicate status, transfer project to client, document lessons learned [T1].
- **Qualities:** Organized, passionate, goal-oriented, comfortable with change, drives change, leads others, culturally aware, servant leader, strong negotiation skills (especially in matrix orgs) [T1, 23, 28, 33, 35].
- **Project Management Constraint Triangle (Iron Triangle):** Balances **Scope, Budget (Cost), Schedule (Time)**, with **Quality** as an overarching factor [T1]. Changes in one constraint impact others [T1]. PM's job is to balance these [T1]. Quality should not be compromised [T1].
- **Managing Expectations:** A core PM responsibility, particularly for technical PMs [T1]. A well-defined scope helps a PM push back on out-of-scope requests or justify additional resources [T1].
- **"Overhead" Perception:** PMs can sometimes be seen as overhead because they facilitate work rather than directly performing technical tasks [T1].

**IV. Project Management Process Groups (5)**

These define **what a project manager does** chronologically in a traditional project [T1].

1.  **Initiating the Project:**
    - Define initial scope and identify stakeholders [T1]. Understand business environment, strategy, assets [T1]. Develop **business case** [T1].
    - **Project Charter (Key Document):** Prepared by PM or sponsor. **Justifies the project**, provides high-level overview, gives PM authority, aligns stakeholders [T1].
      - **Contents:** Justification, objectives/deliverables, measurable goals (requirements & constraints), stakeholders/team, high-level budget/ROI, milestones/timeline, potential risks, resources, approval requirements [T1].
      - It is the **first process in the Initiating phase** and belongs to **Project Integration Management** [T1].
2.  **Planning the Project:**
    - Define activities, duration, cost, resources, build schedule, identify/mitigate risks [T1]. Develop **scope of work**, detailed estimates, quality plans, communication strategy, and procurement plans [T1]. A good plan is vital for success [T1].
3.  **Executing the Project:**
    - Assemble team, set ground rules, procure resources, determine milestones [T1]. Much of the project's actual work occurs here [T1]. PM focuses on leading and developing the team [T1].
4.  **Monitoring and Controlling the Project:**
    - Ensure project stays on track, meets milestones and quality standards [T1]. Collect performance data, compare to metrics, implement risk mitigation, communicate status [T1]. Track, review, regulate progress; apply corrective actions [T1].
5.  **Closing the Project:**
    - Gain customer approval, hand over project, complete final documentation, write report, and share **lessons learned** [T1].

**V. Project Management Knowledge Areas (10)**

These define **what a project manager needs to know** [T1].

    - **Project Scope Statement:** Documented description of scope, deliverables, boundaries, responsibilities, estimates [T1]. Ensures stakeholder understanding [T1].
    - **Scope Management Plan:** Defines how change requests are handled, how WBS is developed, and how deliverables are approved [T1].
    - **Scope Creep:** Out-of-scope requests from stakeholders; PMs must avoid this, using formal change control if necessary [T1].

      - _Planning:_ Plan Scope Management, Collect Requirements, Define Scope, Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) [T1].
      - _Monitoring & Controlling:_ Validate Scope (stakeholder approval), Control Scope (prevent creep) [T1].
3.  **Schedule Management:** Ensures timely project completion [T1].
4.  **Cost Management:** Ensures project completion within budget [T1].
5.  **Quality Management:** Ensures deliverables satisfy needs; PMs measure quality and take corrective actions [T1].
6.  **Resource Management:** Identifies, acquires, and manages physical and human resources for project completion.
    - **Resources:** Capital (equipment, land, buildings, funding, office space), Technology (software, data protection), and People (team members) [T1].

- **Two Categories:**
  - **Content Theories:** Focus on **what** motivates us (needs, aspirations).
  - **Process Theories:** Focus on **how** motivation occurs (the process by which motivation happens).
- **Content Theories:**
  - **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:** Five levels in a hierarchy: Physiological, Safety, Social, Esteem, Self-Actualization. Lower needs must be met before moving to higher ones.
  - **Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory:**
    - **Motivators:** Encourage harder work if present (e.g., interesting job).
    - **Hygiene Factors:** Cause unmotivation if _not_ present (e.g., poor working conditions, poor pay).
  - **Three Needs Theory:** Three needs exist on a scale: Achievement, Affiliation (collaboration, group belonging), Power. Managers can use to set tailored motivational targets.
  - **McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y:**
    - **Theory X:** Assumes employees are lazy, unmotivated, avoid work; requires control/supervision.
    - **Theory Y:** Assumes employees are ambitious, self-motivated; perform well if provided with the right conditions.
  - **ERG Theory (Alderfer):** Simplified Maslow's. Three hierarchical needs: Existence (physical well-being), Relatedness (to others), Growth (personal development, meaningful work).
  - **Mayo's Motivation Theory:** Group performance depends on **norms** (positive/negative behavior) and **group cohesiveness** (getting along). High cohesiveness + positive norms = highest motivation/performance. Mayo was first to recognise good employee treatment leads to productivity.
- **Process Theories:**
  - **Adam's Equity Theory:** High motivation when treatment is perceived as fair relative to others. Individuals adjust inputs (work done) to compensate for perceived unfairness of outputs (pay).
  - **Vroom's Expectancy Theory:** Behavior chosen based on expected results. Three factors for motivation: **Expectancy** (effort leads to achievable targets), **Instrumentality** (hitting targets leads to reward), **Valence** (value/want the reward). Motivation is higher if these factors are high.
  - **Taylor's Scientific Management (Motivation Aspect):** Believed employees are only motivated by **money**. Workers don't inherently enjoy work, so employers must monitor closely to ensure efficiency.
  - **Self-Efficacy Theory:** Task-specific motivation. Higher self-efficacy (belief in performing a task) leads to more motivation. Four factors: Experience, Vicarious experience (seeing others succeed), Social persuasion (encouragement), Physiological feedback (ease with task).
  - **Reinforcement Theory:** Four factors influence motivation (encourage good, discourage bad behavior):
    - **Positive Reinforcement:** Reward for desired behavior.
    - **Negative Reinforcement:** Reward by removing something negative.
    - **Punishment:** Threat of negative consequence to stop undesirable behavior.
    - **Extinction:** Stopping learned behavior by withholding positive reinforcement.
  - **Locke's Goal-Setting Theory:** Setting the right goals increases motivation and productivity. Right goals must have: **Clarity, Challenge** (but not too much), **Commitment, Feedback**, and appropriate **Task Complexity**.

**XII. Emotional Intelligence (EQ)**

- **Definition:** Awareness and recognition of one's own emotions, and those of team members. Helps use emotions for the good of the team.
- **Daniel Goleman's Four Categories (1995):**
  1.  **Self-awareness:** Understanding one's own emotions, drives, strengths, weaknesses.
  2.  **Self-management:** Managing one's emotions and behavior.
  3.  **Social awareness:** Tuning into others, recognising/understanding emotions, empathy.
  4.  **Relationship management:** Applying emotional understanding in communication and collaboration.

**XIII. PMI Global Megatrends (Since 2020)**

- PMI report studying workplace changes due to technology, demographics, globalization complexities. Six large global megatrends:
  1.  **Acceleration of the Digital World:** Digital transformation (ML, AI, Cloud, IoT) enabling remote work and global collaboration.
  2.  **Climate Crisis:** PMI predicts sustainability practices must be built into every project/process to combat climate change.
  3.  **Shifting Demographics of the Workforce:**
      - 25 million new PM professionals needed in 8 years (talent gap).
      - **Great Resignation:** People resigning/changing jobs in record numbers (coined during pandemic).
      - Suggestions: Incorporate technology to reduce PM workload, recruit younger workers.
  4.  **Disruption in the Supply Chain & Economic Shifts:**
      - Historic labor shortage (early 2020s), made complex by women/minorities leaving workforce due to pandemic and not returning (disillusioned by work-life balance).
      - PMI suggests stronger cross-border collaborations for knowledge sharing and global recovery.
      - Organisations need to reset the employer-employee relationship to retain good employees.
  5.  **People Want More from Companies:** Workers desire to work for companies with a positive social impact, and want individual contributions recognized and rewarded.
  6.  **Demand for Equity (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - DEI):**
      - Systematic integration of DEI for a more equitable workforce.
      - Includes equal pay for women/ethnic minorities, inclusion for disabled employees, safe spaces for LGBTQ employees.
      - PMI suggestions: Embed DEI in every function/process, engage employees in policy/goal creation, form resource groups, recruit/retain diverse talent, cultivate inclusive culture.

**XIV. Innovative Teams & Diversity/Inclusion**

- **Pressure:** Organisations face increasing pressure to cultivate diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environments.
- **Business Case for Diversity:** Leads to stronger innovation, improved employee retention, better financial outcomes (e.g., higher procurement ROI), and attracts job seekers who value inclusion. Societal expectations are also driving corporate strategies.
- **Key Challenges:**
  - **Narrow Focus on Representation:** Often only addresses demographic diversity in hiring, not career advancement, mentorship, or leadership roles.
  - **Overly Simplistic Approaches:** Treats individuals as broad demographic groups, ignoring personal/professional nuances.
  - **Lack of Integration:** Viewed as compliance, not a fundamental business driver for innovation or market expansion.
- **Strategic Shifts for Leaders (BCG Recommendations):**
  1.  **Expand Scope of Workforce Inclusion Efforts:** Beyond demographics, recognise intersectionality of identities, address full employee experience (recruitment to leadership), develop policies for functional (pay equity) and emotional (feeling valued) satisfaction.
  2.  **Embed Inclusive Practices Across Business Operations:** Leverage diversity for innovation (products for underserved communities), expand supplier diversity, partner with external stakeholders for systemic change.
  3.  **Use Data-Driven Metrics to Measure Impact:** Assess representation, inclusion, progression, retention; align with business objectives (financial, customer, market); enhance transparency, hold leadership accountable.
  4.  **Amplify the Role of Business in Societal Change:** Leadership in promoting inclusion builds brand loyalty, attracts talent, aligns with ESG criteria, supports diverse entrepreneurs.
- **Overall Shift:** From treating inclusion as a compliance requirement to embedding it as a core driver of business success for competitive advantage.

**XV. PMI (Project Management Institute)**

- **Role:** Non-profit global professional organization, provides resources and training, advances the profession [T1].
- **Certification:** Offers the **Project Management Professional (PMP)** certification, a globally recognized standard [T1].
- **PMBOK:** Maintains the **Project Management Body of Knowledge**, a foundational resource [T1].

**XVI. Processes (49)**

- There are 49 specific processes (tools/techniques) for PMs. Each fits into a process group and knowledge area [T1].

**XVII. Project Management Software & Tools**

- Commercially available software programs provide templates for managing project scope, schedule, and budgeting applications [T1]. Companies must determine which program or template is best for their specific project [T1].
- **Gantt Charts with Google Sheets:**
  - Gantt charts can be accessed via **Google Sheets template gallery**.
  - To find them: Open Google Sheets, go to the **template gallery** on the upper right-hand side, then select **general templates**, and scroll down.
  - There are **four different project management templates** available on Google Sheets: **Gantt chart project timeline, project tracking, event marketing timeline**, and one other which functions similarly for Gantt charts.
  - These templates are **customizable/editable** (e.g., project name, specific cells).
  - They are useful for course projects, personal use, or professional use.

### **Project Management: Comprehensive Crisp Notes**

**I. Core Concepts**

- **Project:** A **temporary effort that creates value** [Previous Transcript, T1]. It has a beginning and an end, is unique, initiates change, and results in a deliverable [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Temporary Nature:** Projects have start and end dates. They conclude when objectives are met, funding runs out, need ceases, or they are cancelled [Previous Transcript, T1]. Without an end date, it's considered **operations** (ongoing) [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Unique:** Projects fulfill a specific objective or create a new product/service [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Create Value:** Deliver tangible (e.g., rocket booster) or intangible (e.g., software update) value [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Management (Henri Fayol's Definition):** Functions include Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, and Controlling [Previous Transcript, T1]. Modern adaptation includes Planning, Organizing, **Leadership** (combining commanding and coordinating), and Controlling [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Project Management:** Applying specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to **deliver value** [Previous Transcript, T1]. PMI defines it as such [Previous Transcript, T1].

**II. Functions of Management (Detailed)**

- **Planning:** Setting direction, communicating goals, defining methods, steps, and resources [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Organizing:** Assembling resources (people, funding, equipment) to achieve goals [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Leading/Leadership:** Focusing on human aspects: hiring, managing, training, coaching, performance review, setting an example [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Controlling:** Verifying adherence to plan, schedule, and budget [Previous Transcript, T1].

**III. The Project Manager (PM) Role and Responsibilities**

- **Core Role:** Ultimate responsibility for project success [Previous Transcript, T1]. Connects people to resources and processes, sets direction, applies PM tools, and leads teams to deliver value [Previous Transcript, T1]. A good PM is a **problem solver** [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Key Activities:** Define tasks, develop plans, manage resources, establish metrics, communicate status, transfer project to client, document lessons learned [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Qualities:** Organized, passionate, goal-oriented, comfortable with change, drives change, leads others, culturally aware, servant leader, strong negotiation skills (especially in matrix orgs) [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Project Management Constraint Triangle (Iron Triangle):** Balances **Scope, Budget (Cost), Schedule (Time)**, with **Quality** as an overarching factor [Previous Transcript, T1]. Changes in one constraint impact others [Previous Transcript, T1]. PM's job is to balance these [Previous Transcript, T1]. Quality should not be compromised [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Managing Expectations:** A core PM responsibility, particularly for technical PMs [Previous Transcript, T1]. A well-defined scope helps a PM push back on out-of-scope requests or justify additional resources [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **"Overhead" Perception:** PMs can sometimes be seen as overhead because they facilitate work rather than directly performing technical tasks [Previous Transcript, T1].

**IV. Project Management Process Groups (5)**

These define **what a project manager does** chronologically in a traditional project [Previous Transcript, T1].

1.  **Initiating the Project:**
    - Define initial scope and identify stakeholders [Previous Transcript, T1]. Understand business environment, strategy, assets [Previous Transcript, T1]. Develop **business case** [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Project Charter (Key Document):** Prepared by PM or sponsor. **Justifies the project**, provides high-level overview, gives PM authority, aligns stakeholders [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - **Contents:** Justification, objectives/deliverables, measurable goals (requirements & constraints), stakeholders/team, high-level budget/ROI, milestones/timeline, potential risks, resources, approval requirements [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - It is the **first process in the Initiating phase** and belongs to **Project Integration Management** [Previous Transcript, T1].
2.  **Planning the Project:**
    - Define activities, duration, cost, resources, build schedule, identify/mitigate risks [Previous Transcript, T1]. Develop **scope of work**, detailed estimates, quality plans, communication strategy, and procurement plans [Previous Transcript, T1]. A good plan is vital for success [Previous Transcript, T1].
3.  **Executing the Project:**
    - Assemble team, set ground rules, procure resources, determine milestones [Previous Transcript, T1]. Much of the project's actual work occurs here [Previous Transcript, T1]. PM focuses on leading and developing the team [Previous Transcript, T1].
4.  **Monitoring and Controlling the Project:**
    - Ensure project stays on track, meets milestones and quality standards [Previous Transcript, T1]. Collect performance data, compare to metrics, implement risk mitigation, communicate status [Previous Transcript, T1]. Track, review, regulate progress; apply corrective actions [Previous Transcript, T1].
5.  **Closing the Project:**
    - Gain customer approval, hand over project, complete final documentation, write report, and share **lessons learned** [Previous Transcript, T1].

**V. Project Management Knowledge Areas (10)**

These define **what a project manager needs to know** [Previous Transcript, T1].

1.  **Integration Management:** Coordinates all project elements. **Most important** for informed decision-making and continuous throughout the lifecycle [Previous Transcript, T1]. The Project Charter falls under this [Previous Transcript, T1].
2.  **Scope Management:** Ensures **all and only** the required work for successful completion [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **PMI Definition:** Work required for deliverables, managing changes, staying on time/budget [Previous Transcript, T1]. Defines project boundaries (what you _will_ and _won't_ do) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Project Scope Statement:** Documented description of scope, deliverables, boundaries, responsibilities, estimates [Previous Transcript, T1]. Ensures stakeholder understanding [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Scope Management Plan:** Defines how change requests are handled, how WBS is developed, and how deliverables are approved [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Scope Creep:** Out-of-scope requests from stakeholders; PMs must avoid this, using formal change control if necessary [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Six Processes:**
      - _Planning:_ Plan Scope Management, Collect Requirements, Define Scope, Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - _Monitoring & Controlling:_ Validate Scope (stakeholder approval), Control Scope (prevent creep) [Previous Transcript, T1].
3.  **Schedule Management:** Ensures timely project completion [Previous Transcript, T1].
4.  **Cost Management:**
    - **Definition:** The knowledge area containing processes to **plan the budget, estimate activity costs, and manage/control the project budget**. It's crucial for delivering the project **on budget**.
    - **Overall Project Cost:** The sum of all its activities.
    - **Processes (4 across Planning and Monitoring & Controlling groups):**
      1.  **Plan Cost Management:** Create the **Cost Management Plan**, a document detailing how costs will be planned, estimated, and controlled.
      2.  **Estimate Costs:** Determine activity costs using historical information, supplier consultation, or industry standard techniques.
      3.  **Determine Budget:** Project manager takes cost estimates and establishes a **Cost Baseline**. The budget includes all necessary funds for project execution.
      4.  **Control Costs:** Continuously monitor and control the budget by comparing actual expenditures to the baseline budget. Uses **Earned Value Management (EVM)** tools.
    - **Types of Costs:**
      - **Direct Costs:** Easily assigned or billed directly to the project (e.g., project team wages if 100% dedicated, materials).
      - **Indirect Costs:** Cannot be easily associated with a single project; resources shared across multiple projects (e.g., quality control, PMO office, corporate tech support).
      - **Fixed Costs:** Do not usually change over time or with the number of units produced (e.g., lease payments, software licenses).
      - **Variable Costs:** Change proportionally to the amount of output produced (e.g., material cost for each unit).
      - **Important Note:** A cost is either direct OR indirect (not both), and either fixed OR variable (not both). However, a cost can be both **direct and variable** (e.g., additional assembly line workers for increased output).
    - **Types of Estimates (by accuracy):**
      1.  **Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM):** Very rough, used at the beginning of the project as an educated guess. Accuracy: **-25% to +75%**.
      2.  **Budget Estimate:** More refined, useful for project planning and approval decisions. Accuracy: **-10% to +25%**.
      3.  **Definitive Estimate:** Most accurate, developed when the project is planned in detail and activities/costs are thoroughly analysed. Accuracy: **-5% to +10%**.
    - **Estimation Tools & Techniques (similar to schedule estimation):**
      - **Analogous Estimating (Top-Down):** Uses historical information from similar past projects/activities. Faster but less accurate.
      - **Parametric Estimating:** Mathematical modeling based on specific parameters (e.g., cost per unit of measure like cubic yard, gallon, hour of labor) and historical data.
      - **Bottom-Up Estimating:** Estimates **every single activity** from the WBS (including all cost types), then aggregates for total project cost. More time-consuming but **much more precise**.
      - **Three-Point Estimating:** Uses Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for optimistic (O), most likely (M), and pessimistic (P) cost scenarios. Formula: **(O + M + P) / 3**.
      - **PERT Estimating:** Similar to Three-Point, but puts **more weight on the most likely scenario**. Formula: **(O + 4M + P) / 6**. Result is closer to the most likely estimate than Three-Point.
    - **Project Budget & Reserves:**
      - **Project Budget:** Total projected costs needed to complete the project, representing all authorized funds.
      - **Cost Performance Baseline (Cost Baseline / BAC - Budget At Completion):** Approved budget including contingency reserves, serving as the **baseline for measuring project performance** (e.g., against predicted milestones, actual expenditures). It forecasts funding requirements and measures performance.
      - **Contingency Reserves:** Additional amount added to activity costs to cover **known risks** (e.g., 2-5% for anticipated supply chain issues). Also applies to schedules. Important to include for realistic planning.
      - **Management Reserve:** Amount held **outside the cost baseline** for **unknown risks/uncertainty**. **Not controlled by the project manager** (controlled by management, sponsor, or PMO). Requires a change process to access.
      - **Total Project Budget Formula:** Cost Baseline + Management Reserve.
    - **Earned Value Management (EVM):** Tool used to track budget and communicate with stakeholders. Monitors project progress in terms of schedule and cost. (PMP exam requires formula memorization, but not for this course).
5.  **Quality Management:** Ensures deliverables satisfy needs; PMs measure quality and take corrective actions [Previous Transcript, T1].
6.  **Resource Management:** Identifies, acquires, and manages physical and human resources for project completion [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Resources:** Capital (equipment, land, buildings, funding, office space), Technology (software, data protection), and People (team members) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Six Processes:** Plan Resource Management, Estimate Activity Resources, Acquire Resources, Develop Team, Manage Team, Control Resources [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Tools:** Project organization chart, Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM), RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) Chart, Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Negotiating for Resources:** Crucial, especially when resources are scarce or schedule is compressed [Previous Transcript, T1].
7.  **Communications Management:** Ensures timely and secure generation, collection, sharing, and archiving of project knowledge. Poor communication is a major cause of project failure [Previous Transcript, T1].
8.  **Risk Management:** Identifies, analyses, and responds to project risks (e.g., schedule delays, resource loss) [Previous Transcript, T1].
9.  **Procurement Management:**
    - **Definition:** The knowledge area containing processes for project managers to **purchase or acquire products or services from outside the project team**. This applies when resources (materials, services, people) are not made internally or already on hand.
    - **Importance:** Projects create value through deliverables, which require resources. Procurement is essential when those resources must be externally sourced. PMs collaborate with procurement/purchasing offices.
    - **Processes (3 across Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling groups):**
      1.  **Plan Procurement Management:** PM creates the **Procurement Management Plan**, detailing procurement activities, constraints, stakeholder roles, and criteria for evaluating bids.
      2.  **Conduct Procurements:** Obtaining seller responses, contacting, selecting, and awarding contracts. May involve preferred vendors, formal RFPs, or third-party review for unbiased selection.
      3.  **Control Procurements:** Managing vendor relationships (communication, performance), corrective actions, and closing contracts (fulfilled or cancelled).
    - **Make or Buy Decisions:** Weighing costs of internal production versus external sourcing (equipment, personnel, expertise). The decision to outsource initiates the procurement process.
    - **Supplier Selection & Management:** Crucial for project success. Suppliers are important stakeholders. Requires strategic processes.
      - **Procurement Documents:**
        - **Statement of Work (SOW):** Detailed, legally binding overview of project scope, requirements, deliverables, timeline, invoicing, and payment terms.
        - **Terms of Reference (TOR):** Describes **technical requirements** (e.g., engineering work, specific licenses/credentials, permits, standards, regulations). Especially important for technical or regulated projects.
        - **Request for Quote (RFQ) / Request for Proposal (RFP):** Formal invitation to potential suppliers to bid on the contract.
      - **Evaluation:** Receiving and evaluating multiple bids based on criteria like supplier history, risk, references, and quality.
      - **Negotiation:** Back-and-forth on pricing, payment terms, etc..
      - **Contract Award & Performance:** Awarding the contract, followed by supplier performance/delivery.
    - **Contracts:** Legally binding agreements creating mutual, enforceable obligations.
      - **Elements:** Offer, Consideration (value exchanged), Acceptance, Mutuality ("meeting of the minds"), Legality.
      - **Types (and Risks):**
        - **Fixed Price Contract:** Deliverables clearly defined, fixed price. **Seller assumes more risk**.
        - **Fixed Price Incentive Contract:** Fixed price with bonuses for early delivery or meeting requirements.
        - **Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment:** Fixed price adjustable for material/labor cost changes.
        - **Time and Material (T&M) Contracts:** For outsourcing labor/materials when exact time is unknown. **Buyer assumes higher risk** (costs can get out of hand).
        - **Cost Plus Contract:** Buyer pays actual costs + predetermined fee for ambiguous requirements. **Buyer assumes risk** (supplier not incentivized to finish early/on time).
        - **Retainer:** Buyer prepays for specific employee hours when SOW is unclear. **Buyer assumes risk** (paid in advance).
    - **Supplier Relationship Management (SRM):** Crucial part of controlling procurements. Monitoring performance and actively managing relationships to drive innovation.
10. **Stakeholder Management:** Identifies and builds relationships with people/organizations impacted by the project [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Stakeholder:** Anyone with influence or power over the project, team, or outcome (customer, team, investors, suppliers, government) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Goal:** Manage stakeholder expectations to achieve project deliverables [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Four Processes:** Identify Stakeholders, Plan Stakeholder Management, Manage Stakeholder Engagement, Monitor Stakeholder Engagement [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Types:** Internal (sponsor, team, board), External (investors, suppliers, community), Clients (customer, end-user), Governmental/Regulatory (IRS, EPA, FDA) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Stakeholder Analysis:** Identify early, determine interests/influence [Previous Transcript, T1]. Categorize by interest, influence, involvement [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Salience Model:** Classifies stakeholders by **Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency** into seven categories (e.g., Definitive stakeholders have all three and require most engagement) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Power Interest Grid (Most Common):** Classifies by **Power** (Y-axis) and **Interest** (X-axis) [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - **Players (High Interest, High Power):** Keep engaged, seek collaboration (e.g., sponsor, customer) [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - **Subjects (High Interest, Low Power):** Consult for insights, keep informed (e.g., key admin support) [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - **Context Setters (High Power, Low Interest):** Keep satisfied (e.g., Director of Engineering) [Previous Transcript, T1].
      - **Crowd (Low Power, Low Interest):** Provide information, no feedback expected (e.g., website updates) [Previous Transcript, T1].
    - **Relationship with Communications Management:** These two areas are intertwined; stakeholder management relies on effective communication and engagement [Previous Transcript, T1].

**VI. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

- **Definition:** A graphical tool that breaks down project deliverables into smaller **work packages** [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Purpose:** Identifies every project element, ensures all deliverables are detailed, and nothing is missed [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Structure:** Level one is the project deliverable, broken down into smaller components at level two and further into work packages [Previous Transcript, T1]. Broken down to the lowest level for accurate time, cost, and resource estimation [Previous Transcript, T1]. Tasks typically start with verbs [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Uses:** Project cost budgeting (estimating each component), project timing (building sequence, schedule, milestones), identifying dependencies, and determining the critical path [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **WBS Dictionary:** Adds context, describes work packages, detailing assumptions and interdependencies. Helps prevent scope creep and aids communication [Previous Transcript, T1].

**VII. Project Management Methodologies**

- **A. Waterfall (Traditional/Predictive):**
  - **Focus:** Comprehensive plan followed strictly [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **When to Use:** Requirements are **well known and stable** (e.g., building a house, bridge, plane) [Previous Transcript, T1]. Changes are expensive [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Flow:** Sequential phases: Requirements, Design, Develop/Build, Test, Deploy [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Outcome:** Usually **one big outcome** at the end [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Tools:** Uses traditional WBS [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Measurement:** Against an original plan or **baseline** [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **B. Agile:**
  - **Focus:** Collaborative, adaptable to evolving requirements [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **When to Use:** Requirements are **not well known or likely to change** (e.g., software development, innovative projects) [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Collaboration:** Close customer involvement throughout [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Sprints:** Work done in fixed **time-boxes** (typically 1-4 weeks), delivering increments after each sprint [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Backlog:** Uses a **product/project backlog** for gathering and prioritizing requirements. Work for sprints is pulled from high-priority items [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Feedback:** Increments are showcased to customer for feedback, leading to new requirements and reprioritization [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Scrum:** A common Agile approach [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **C. Hybrid:**
  - **Definition:** Combines elements of Waterfall and Agile, customised to specific project/organisation needs [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Application:** Can switch methodologies for different phases or run concurrently (e.g., Waterfall for hardware, Agile for software in a plane build) [Previous Transcript, T1].

**VIII. Organisational Structures: Matrix Organisations**

- **Definition:** A management structure where employees report to **two or more bosses** (functional manager and project manager). Allows cross-functional work but adds complexity [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Traditional Structure:** Single chain of command, one manager [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Pros of Matrix:** Increases flexibility and productivity, efficient resource use (sharing, re-allocation), access to **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)** [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Cons of Matrix:** Complexity, challenging for team members with competing interests from two managers, competition for best resources, increased potential for conflict [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Balance of Power (Project Manager's Authority):**
  - **Weak Matrix:** PM has the **least power**, acts more as a **project coordinator**. Functional manager holds most managerial power [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Balanced Matrix:** Power is **shared equally**. Can be difficult for team members. PM typically has authority only over project-related tasks and allocated resources [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Strong Matrix:** PM has the **greatest power**, including a say in resource allocation for the entire project, often holding more power than the functional manager [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Negotiation Skills:** **Strong negotiation skills are necessary** for PMs in matrix organisations due to competition for internal resources [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Performance Appraisals:** PMs may have responsibility for deliverables but not the authority to evaluate team members' performance in matrix organisations [Previous Transcript, T1].

**IX. Project Team Development**

- **Importance:** Having the right people makes or breaks a project. PMs build, enhance, cultivate, and manage conflicts within teams, setting the tone [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Tuckman's Stages of Team Development (1960s, Bruce Tuckman):**
  1.  **Forming:** Team comes together [Previous Transcript, T1].
  2.  **Storming:** Conflicts and differences emerge [Previous Transcript, T1].
  3.  **Norming:** Team establishes norms, resolves conflicts [Previous Transcript, T1].
  4.  **Performing:** High-functioning, efficient team [Previous Transcript, T1].
  5.  **Adjourning:** Team or project ends (added more recently) [Previous Transcript, T1].

**X. Leadership and Power**

- **Leadership:** About **influence**, not just management. No single "right" style; may change based on situation [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **French and Raven's Five Bases of Power (late 1950s):**
  1.  **Legitimate Power:** Derived from position or formal relationships (e.g., CEO, VP over intern) [Previous Transcript, T1].
  2.  **Reward Power:** Ability to give benefits for desired actions (e.g., return favour, thank you) [Previous Transcript, T1].
  3.  **Expert Power:** Based on individual's expertise, skill, or competence (e.g., reputation for website design) [Previous Transcript, T1].
  4.  **Referent Power:** Based on likability, strong relationships, and networking ability [Previous Transcript, T1].
  5.  **Coercive Power:** Ability to punish or force compliance (e.g., reprimand, forced overtime). **Not a good power to use** as it leads to unhappy team members [Previous Transcript, T1].
- **Common Leadership Styles:**
  - **Servant Leadership:** Puts team first, empowers, develops members, focuses on needs [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Autocratic Leadership:** Maintains control, doesn't seek input, makes decisions based on own judgment [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Democratic Leadership:** Seeks input from the group, shared leadership [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Charismatic Leadership:** Self-confident, inspires others, enthusiastic, personality-driven [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Directing Leadership:** Lays out clear process, offers specific direction (good for new employees) [Previous Transcript, T1].
  - **Transactional Leadership:** Rewards success, punishes failure, based on rules/regulations [Previous Transcript, T1].
